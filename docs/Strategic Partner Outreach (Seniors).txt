Strategic Partner Outreach (Seniors)
Your Mission: To build a pipeline of strategic partners in South Florida who can refer senior clients to us. This is a two-phase mission: first, we get the leads, then we launch the outreach campaign.
Phase 1: Lead Generation (The Quick Start)
Our first step is to acquire targeted email lists quickly and cost-effectively.
* The Strategy: We will use freelancers on Fiverr.com to get scraped lead lists from Google. These are very affordable and effective for an initial push.
* The Goal: To purchase email lists for the specific partner categories listed in Phase 2.
* The Campaign Tool: Once we have the lists, we will use an email outreach tool like Instantly.ai to run our campaigns.
* Your Task:
   1. Go to Fiverr.com and search for terms like "lead generation," "b2b lead generation," "email scraping," and "google maps scraping."
   2. Find the best-rated and most cost-effective gigs that can provide lead lists for the partner types below (e.g., "email list of financial advisors in Miami").
   3. Create a simple report or list with links to the top 3-5 Fiverr gigs you recommend. Include their price, what they offer (e.g., 500 leads), and any key details.
   4. Send this list to me. I will purchase the best option, and we will start the campaign together.
Phase 2: Partner Categories to Target
This is who we are trying to reach. Our goal is to find people and organizations trusted by seniors (65+).
The Core Offer: We pay $1,000 for each referred client who signs with us, when we go to market in a few months.
Target Channels (These are the lists you will look for on Fiverr):
* Financial & Investment Advisors:
   * Who they are: Financial planners, wealth managers, and retirement advisors. They help seniors manage their money and are a primary source of referrals.
   * Keywords for Fiverr search: "Financial Advisor Miami," "Wealth Management Boca Raton," "Retirement Planning Fort Lauderdale."
* Senior Centers:
   * Who they are: Community centers where seniors socialize and participate in activities. We need contact info for the directors or program managers.
   * Keywords for Fiverr search: "Senior Center Miami-Dade," "Active Adult Community Broward," "55+ Community Florida."
* Churches & Religious Communities:
   * Who they are: Institutions with a strong, tight-knit senior community. We need contact info for the pastor, priest, or community leader.
   * Keywords for Fiverr search: "Churches in South Florida," "Pastors in Miami," "Church Directory Florida."
* Senior Influencers / Community Leaders:
   * Who they are: Respected and active people within online communities (especially Facebook) or leaders of retiree associations.
   * Note: This is a more manual search for later. For now, focus on finding the leads for the first three categories on Fiverr, by comparing options to find the best one
