Senior Salesman Profile    


The Ideal Candidate Profile to Look For:
When you find potential candidates, look for these backgrounds:
* Former Small Business Owners: They have grit, understand sales, and are excellent at building relationships.
* Retired Financial Advisors or Insurance Agents: They have the perfect skill set for your product.
* Successful Real Estate Brokers: They know the market and how to talk about home value.
* 60 year old or older 


1. Professional & Industry Networks (Highest Quality Leads)
This is your best source for finding proven professionals who already have credibility and a network.
* Real Estate Associations: Connect with the Miami Association of Realtors. Many seasoned real estate agents who are semi-retired or looking for less transactional work would be perfect. They understand property, have deep local networks, and are skilled at building trust with homeowners.
* Financial & Estate Planning Associations: Members of the Financial Planning Association (FPA) of Miami or local estate planning councils are ideal. Look for individuals who are winding down their practice but still want to be active. They are experts at discussing complex financial matters with seniors.
* Insurance Professionals: Veteran life insurance or long-term care insurance agents are masters at navigating sensitive conversations with older clients. They understand the emotional and financial nuances of aging.


2. Online Platforms (Targeted Digital Search)
You need to use specific keywords and platforms.
* AARP Job Board: This is the most direct platform. Post your job opening here, as it's the go-to resource for professionals over 50 seeking employment.
* LinkedIn Search Strategy:
   * Use Keywords: Instead of age, search for titles like "Financial Advisor," "Real Estate Broker," "Insurance Agent" in the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area. Then, add keywords like "Semi-Retired," "Consultant," or "Encore Career."
   * Look at Experience: Look for profiles with 30+ years of experience or university graduation dates from before 1985.
   * Target Groups: Join LinkedIn groups for "Florida Retirees," "Miami Business Professionals," or alumni groups for local universities.
* RetirementJobs.com & SeniorJobBank.org: These are niche job boards specifically for experienced workers.


3. Community-Based & Referral Strategies
Leverage the local Miami community directly.
* High-End Country Clubs & Social Clubs: Seasoned professionals often belong to clubs in areas like Coral Gables, Pinecrest, or Key Biscayne. Networking at these locations or connecting with their membership directors can yield excellent referrals.
* Upscale Senior Living Communities: The directors of sales and marketing at these communities are well-connected with the local senior professional network. They can be a source of both clients and potential employees.
* Your Own Professional Network (Lawyers & Accountants): Ask CPAs and attorneys you work with. They have extensive client lists and often know other respected professionals in this age group who are looking for a new challenge.
