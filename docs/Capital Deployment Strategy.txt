HomeInherit Capital Deployment Strategy
Our operating company Homeinheritance Inc will place all of their efforts to acquire seniors to quickly diversify the portfolio.
It is in our best interest to do so as most of the money we make comes from the 5% fee we charge seniors.
1. Deployment Overview
1. Portfolio Scale

   * Target 60 investments per €10 M in the fund.

   * Average remaining interest deployed: Expected ~€150 K per deal (home FMV ~€330 K; many seniors don’t draw full proceeds, and they will be slow to do so, in a draw as they need it basis, allowing us to raise more capital).
We will keep enough reserves to ensure seniors have money if they want it.
