Senior Master Agreement
This Senior’s Master Agreement (“Agreement”) is made effective as of the date signed below, between:                                                                 a) HomeInheritance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Fund” or “HomeInherit”), and b) the undersigned homeowner(s) (“Seniors “you,” or “your”). 
This Agreement sets forth the terms under which:
1) the Senior(s), as the legal owners of the home residence, will retain the life estate (i.e., ‘lifetime occupancy rights’) in their home, the Fund will receive and hold the remainder interest (‘inheritance interest’), 3) the Senior homeowner(s) will cooperate to preserve the home and yard during their life(s), and ultimately sell the home after the last Senior homeowner’s death. This agreement is written in plain language to be clear, concise, and respectful, while still providing the protections required by law and good business practice.
1. Summary of Key Facts
This agreement is not a loan. You will never owe HomeInheritance Inc or the Fund a repayment during your lifetime.
* No loss of your home. You keep the right to live in and use your home for the rest of your life. You may continue to enjoy all the benefits of home ownership as long as you abide by this Agreement.
* Peace of Mind Program. You are required to enroll in the Peace of Mind Program. At closing of this agreement, we will arrange payment(s) to a third-party administrator to manage and pay for your lifetime property expenses, such as property taxes, insurance and HOA fees. Alternatively, for clients who prefer a different option, we can take a more direct approach. Homeinherit Inc. will simply set aside a reserve to cover all future property expenses like HOA dues, insurance, and taxes. We calculate this amount based on the homeowner’s life expectancy plus a five-year safety net, guaranteeing that all future costs are fully handled and providing complete security for everyone involved.
* Access Your Home's Value. You have the option to receive cash based on your home's current value. In exchange, a portion of your Heirs' future inheritance will be transferred to the Fund.
* Our Service Fees. For our services, HomeInheritance, Inc. charges a 5% fee based on the value of its Remainder Interest, paid from its share of the final sale proceeds. If you choose to access money, there is a 1.8% charge on the amount you receive.
* Closing costs and remainder interest. At signing, the Fund acquires a remainder interest in your home. Your remainder interest is the value of the home minus the closing costs and any approved property improvement costs (see §5). You retain a life estate.
* Plain language. We avoid legal jargon and long sentences. Bold labels and simple headings help you find what matters fast. If anything is unclear, please ask for clarification before you sign.
* Cooling‑off period. You may cancel this Agreement within three (3) business days after signing without penalty.
* Privacy. We protect your personal information and use it only for program purposes. We do not sell your data.
* Arbitration. Disputes are resolved through a three‑step process: negotiation, mediation, then binding arbitration. This keeps matters private and out of court.
2. Definitions
For ease of reference, capitalized terms have the meanings below:
* Property: your home located at the address and legal description you will provide in Schedule A. It includes all fixtures and improvements.
* Life Estate: your right to use, occupy, and enjoy the Property during your lifetime.
* Remainder Interest: the Fund’s and your heirs’ combined right to receive and own the Property after your life estate ends. The Fund’s share is set out in Schedule B.
* Peace of Mind Program: The mandatory program where the Senior pays a lump sum at closing to a third-party administrator who will manage and pay for specified lifetime property expenses, such as property taxes, homeowners insurance, and HOA/condo fees.
* Approved Selling Costs: the reasonable costs of selling the Property after your death, including real estate agent commissions, escrow fees, title insurance, and other normal closing costs agreed to by the Fund.
* Net Sale Proceeds: the gross sale price paid at closing minus (i) any unpaid mortgages previously approved by the Fund; (ii) all Approved Selling Costs; and (iii) any Protective Advances (as defined below) paid by the Fund. Net Sale Proceeds are distributed to the Fund and to your Heirs under §8.4.
* Heirs: your heirs, beneficiaries, or any person assigned to receive an interest in the Property upon your death.
* Memorandum of Agreement (MOA): a short notice recorded in the public property records to let others know about this Agreement. It does not change your daily use of the home but alerts third parties that the Fund has rights.
* Protective Advance: any payment the Fund makes on your behalf to protect the Property (for example, for emergency repairs not covered by the Peace of Mind Program). These advances are repaid with simple interest from the sale proceeds.
* Successor Manager: a corporate escrow company or other trusted party named in Schedule B that will manage the sale and distribution of proceeds if HomeInherit cannot perform its duties.
3. Senior’s Obligations
3.1 Peace of Mind Program
You will enroll in the Peace of Mind Program at closing. This program requires you to pay a one-time lump sum to a third-party administrator. That administrator will then be responsible for the timely payment of all your property taxes, homeowner association dues, condominium fees, and homeowners insurance premiums for as long as you live in the home.
3.2 Maintenance and Waste
You will keep the Property in good repair and prevent damage or neglect that lowers its value. If you fail to maintain the Property and it requires repairs, the cost may be paid from closing costs or by the Fund as a Protective Advance. That cost will be deducted from the Net Sale Proceeds.
3.3 Prohibition on New Debts Against the Property
You will not take on or permit any new mortgage, loan, lien (a legal claim on your property for an unpaid debt), or other claims against your Property without getting the Fund's written permission first. This helps protect your home from unexpected debt. You can not sell any remainder interest of your home to an external company.
Any existing mortgage or lien on the property must be paid off in full from the proceeds of the Fund's investment, ensuring the Fund's interest is secured by a debt-free asset.


3.4 Prohibition on Transfer or Altering Title
You will not sell, gift, transfer, or change the title or designated remainder beneficiaries of the Property without the Fund’s written permission first. This ensures the Fund’s investment remains secure.
3.5 Heir and Representative Designation
You will complete, sign, and provide to the Fund at closing an “Heir and Representative Designation Form.” This form will identify your known or expected Heirs and provide their contact information. You agree to give the Fund updated information in writing if this changes.
3.6 Notice of Important Events
You will promptly notify the Fund in writing if any of the following occur: (a) you receive notice of a tax problem, lien, or foreclosure; (b) you intend to file for bankruptcy; (c) you receive notice that your insurance has been cancelled; or (d) you plan to be away from the Property for more than thirty (30) days.
4. Fund’s Rights & Protections
* Recording of Memorandum. The Fund will record a Memorandum of Agreement in the county public records.
* Right of Inspection. With reasonable notice, the Fund may inspect the Property during normal hours to check on its condition.
* Right to Fix Problems. If you fail to meet your obligations under this Agreement, the Fund has the right (but not the duty) to fix the problem and pay for it as a Protective Advance.
* Right to Manage Post‑Death Sale. The Fund has the exclusive right to choose the real estate agent and manage the sale process after your death as described in §8.
* Successor Manager. If HomeInherit is dissolved, bankrupt, or otherwise unable to perform its duties, the Successor Manager named in Schedule B will take over with full authority.
5. Closing Costs, Remainder Interest & Property Improvements
At closing, costs are deducted to determine your and the Fund’s respective shares.
* Closing Costs. Standard closing costs (title insurance, escrow fees, recording taxes, etc.) are deducted from the Property's value to determine the Remainder Interest. That amount is then divided between the Fund and your Heirs according to Schedule B.
* Property Improvement Costs. If the Property needs repairs to be livable or sellable, the cost will come from closing costs or a Protective Advance from the Fund. These costs reduce the Net Sale Proceeds.
* Calculation Example. Suppose the Property value is $300,000. Closing costs are $15,000 and property improvement costs are $10,000. The remaining $275,000 is the value of the Remainder Interest. If Schedule B says the Fund receives 60% and your Heirs receive 40%, then $165,000 goes to the Fund and $110,000 to your Heirs (before any adjustments for Protective Advances).
6. Accessing Your Home's Value & Our Service Fees
6.1 Accessing Cash From Your Home's Value
You have the flexibility to access cash from the value of your home. If you wish to do so:
1. You will make a written request to the Fund for a specific cash amount.
2. The Fund will then determine the current value of your Property using our standard valuation methods.
3. Based on this value, we will calculate the percentage of the Remainder Interest that corresponds to your requested cash amount. This percentage will be transferred from your Heirs' share to the Fund's share.
4. Upon your agreement, the Fund will provide you with the cash, minus the Money Access Charge.
6.2 Our Service Fee
For managing this program and providing our services, HomeInheritance, Inc. receives a service fee. This fee is equal to 5% of the value of the Fund's Remainder Interest, calculated based on our property valuation when you sign this Agreement. This fee is fully funded through our internal corporate structure at closing.
6.3 Money Access Charge
If you choose to access money from your home's value as described above, a one-time Money Access Charge of 1.8% will be applied to the cash amount you request. This charge will be deducted from the payment you receive.
6.4 Our Valuation Process is Final
To ensure a fair and consistent process, the Fund will determine the Property's value using our own valuation methods. By signing this Agreement, you, on behalf of yourself and your Heirs, knowingly and irrevocably agree to accept the Fund's valuation methods and results as final and binding. You and your Heirs forever give up any right to challenge or dispute the Fund's valuation of the Property or the methods used to determine it.
7. Insurance and Damage or Destruction
7.1 Maintaining Insurance
The Peace of Mind Program administrator will maintain homeowners insurance covering the replacement cost for damage from fire, wind, hurricane, and (if needed) flood. Coverage for your temporary housing costs (Additional Living Expense) belongs only to you.
7.2 Damage, Escrow, and Use of Funds
If the Property is damaged, all insurance money for property damage must be put into a jointly controlled escrow account. This money can only be used to repair or rebuild the Property. If the damage is major, the Fund may help choose contractors to ensure the money is used correctly.
7.3 Total Loss or Impractical Rebuild
If the Property is a total loss or rebuilding isn't practical, you and the Fund will jointly choose one of these three options within 30 days:
1. Rebuild the Property using the insurance money. Your life estate continues.
2. Sell the land and what's left of the home “as‑is” and split the net proceeds.
3. Buyout the Fund’s interest using the insurance money.
7.4 Catastrophic Damage and Allocation
If the Property is substantially damaged, the insurance money will be divided based on IRS actuarial tables, which determine the value of your life estate and the remainder interest based on your age.
8. Post‑Death Sale Protocol
Upon your death, the following process will apply, unless your Heirs exercise their Right of First Refusal (§9):
1. Notice of Death. Your Heirs must give the Fund a copy of your death certificate.
2. Agent Selection. The Fund has the sole right to choose a licensed real estate agent and set the listing price.
3. Listing and Sale. The Property must be listed within thirty (30) days after notice of death. The Fund will manage the sale. The Property will be sold “as is” unless the Fund decides otherwise.
4. Proceeds Waterfall. At closing, the funds will be paid out in this order:
   1. Pay off any approved mortgages, liens, and taxes.
   2. Pay all Approved Selling Costs.
   3. Repay the Fund for any Protective Advances with interest.
   4. Distribute the remaining Net Sale Proceeds to the Fund and your Heirs according to Schedule B. The 5% Service Fee for HomeInheritance, Inc. will be calculated and paid from the Fund's share of the proceeds.
9. Post-Death Sale & Heir Purchase Right
9.1 Marketing Period (Six Months)
After your death, the Fund will engage a licensed broker, list the Property, and conduct a commercially reasonable marketing for up to six (6) months (the “Marketing Period”). Your heirs will cooperate with reasonable showings, inspections, and sales efforts. Nothing in this section requires the Fund to wait the full Marketing Period. The manager may accept a Bona Fide third-party offer at or above the Fair Price at any time during the Marketing Period.
9.2 Fair Price and Early Acceptance of Qualifying Offers
* 9.2A “Fair Price” means the average of two independent, licensed appraisals obtained by Escrow within thirty (30) days after the start of the Marketing Period. If, during the Marketing Period, a Bona Fide, arm’s length third-party offer is received at a higher price, the Fair Price shall be that higher price. 
* 9.2B Early Acceptance of Qualifying Offers The Manager may accept and enter into a binding contract for any Bona Fide, arm's-length third-party offer at or above the Fair Price at any time during the Marketing Period. In that case, your Heirs have no purchase right under Section 9.3 and shall not delay or object the sale.
9.3 Exercise of Matching Right
To use the Matching Right, your Heirs must deliver to the Fund, within ten (10) business days of getting the Third-Party Offer, (i) a written notice without any conditions of their intent to purchase and (ii) a deposit equal to the one in the Third-Party Offer. Your Heirs acknowledge that their purchase right in this Section applies only if the Property is not under contract at or above the Fair Price by the end of the Marketing Period, and they have no right to delay the Fund’s acceptance of any such offer during the Marketing Period.
9.4 Failure to Exercise
If your Heirs don’t use their Matching Right in time, they will give up their right forever. 
10. Dispute Resolution
Any disagreement related to this Agreement will be resolved in this order:
1. Good‑Faith Negotiation. The parties will try to resolve it through friendly discussions for thirty (30) days.
2. Mediation. If negotiation fails, a neutral mediator will help the parties try to find a solution.
3. Binding Arbitration. If mediation fails, the dispute will be settled by a private arbitrator, not in court. The arbitrator’s decision is final.
11. Covenants Running with the Land
This Agreement creates promises that are tied to the Property itself and are binding on anyone who receives an interest in it. When your Heirs accept their inheritance, they automatically and irrevocably agree to all terms of this Agreement.
* Deed Language. The deed will state that accepting the Property means accepting all the terms of this Senior Master Agreement.
* Agreement Language. This Agreement will state that its obligations are tied to the land and that Heirs are bound by its terms upon acceptance.
Recording a Memorandum of Agreement ensures that all future owners have legal notice of these promises.
12. Contingencies & Default
12.1 Property Damage or Condemnation
If the Property is destroyed or taken by the government, any payout will be held in escrow and divided between you and the other beneficiaries (the Fund and your Heirs) based on IRS tables.
12.2 Default by the Senior
Events of Default include: failing to maintain the property, creating unapproved debts against the property, trying to transfer the title, major neglect of the Property, or breaking any other term of this Agreement. If a default happens, the Fund may:
* Fix the problem and charge it as a Protective Advance.
* Get a court order to prevent waste or an unauthorized sale.
* In severe cases, file a legal action asking for the loss of your life estate.
12.3 Bankruptcy and Senior Declarations

12.4 Successor Manager
If HomeInherit cannot continue its duties, the Successor Manager named in Schedule B will take over.
12.5 Incapacity of the Senior
If you are legally declared unable to manage your affairs, this Agreement stays in effect. Your legal guardian or representative must fulfill your obligations.

12.7 Protocol for Successor Manager
A pre-chosen corporate escrow company will automatically become the Successor Manager if HomeInherit cannot perform its duties.
