Constantly Diversificating
Investing in a single home inheritance has one major uncertainty: timing. While our models give us a strong forecast, the exact timing for any one property is impossible to know for sure. 
This is why our entire model is built to solve this problem by pooling many of these individual, non-correlated assets together. This process transforms unpredictable single events into a highly predictable and stable projected return stream for the entire fund.
The effect is not small; it's a dramatic reduction in projected risk. Our analysis shows how powerful this is for our actuarial returns:
* A portfolio of just 50 deals has a projected risk of about 2.2% before factoring in home appreciation/depreciation.
* A portfolio of 500 deals creates a very stable investment, with a projected risk level of only 0.49%.
This is the core of our risk management strategy. By pooling many homes together, we smooth out the timing risk of individual properties, creating a fund designed to deliver consistent, reliable projected performance. 
Our Evergreen model ensures your investment is constantly being diversified with every single new senior we get.
Our Blueprint for Building a Stronger Portfolio
Our goal is to build the most stable portfolio possible, as quickly as possible. We are moving fast to diversify in several ways to build a strong and stable fund.
1. Geographic Diversification
Relying on a single real estate market, no matter how strong, is a risk. A local downturn could affect property values. To reduce this risk, our strategy is built for rapid geographic expansion. We are launching with a focus on South Florida, a region with strong demand. However, our plan is to expand into other stable, appreciating U.S. markets like California and beyond as soon as we can. This creates a portfolio that is not dependent on the fortunes of any single city or state.
2. Demographic Diversification
Just as we diversify across locations, we will diversify across different senior demographics. By expanding our reach to include a wide range of homeowner profiles across the country, we strengthen our financial models. A broader demographic pool makes our return projections even more reliable and less affected by trends in one specific group or area.
3. Instant, Constant Diversification Through Our Evergreen Fund
Our fund is structured to be "evergreen," meaning it is continuously open to new assets and investors. This provides a powerful, immediate benefit. When you invest, your capital buys into the entire existing portfolio. You get instant exposure to every home we hold, not just the new ones. This means from day one, you receive the full benefit of the diversification we have already built.
The Goal: A Low-Risk, High-Return Fund
Our strategy is simple but powerful. We are building a secure fund for investor capital by adding multiple layers of diversification to an asset with a low projected risk profile. By combining financial modeling with broad geographic and demographic reach, we are creating an investment designed to target consistent, tax-free returns with a structure built for resilience against broader market movements.




OUR EVERGREEN MODEL EXPLAINED
Every investor owns a share in every home we have.
The fund has $9M and Octavius is a new investor and he puts in $1M, he owns 10% of the fund.


So he owns 10% of all the inheritances the fund has for each home.
Example
* Property 1 (we have 30k in remainder interest) (Octavius has 3K of that remainder interest)
* Property 2 (we have 10k in remainder interest) (Octavius has 1K)
* Property 3 (we have 100k in remainder interest)(Octavius has 10K)
* Property 4...
If new investors join the fund,  they get a piece of all homes.
And when new inheritances are bought by the fund, each existing investor, gets their equity diluted in each home because they gain a piece of a new one.
