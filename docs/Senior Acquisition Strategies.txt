Senior Acquisition Strategies
Our complete plan for connecting with seniors through strategic partnerships, direct sales, online marketing, and community engagement.
Our Goal: From Connection to Contract
All of these strategies are designed to do one thing: book appointments for us to meet seniors in their homes. Once we meet them, we will either invite them to our office to sign the contract, or we will return to their home to close the deal there.
1. Strategic Partnerships
* Objective: Partner with ~100 Miami senior living facilities to build a strong referral network.
* Method: Offer a generous financial reward of $1,000 - $2,000 for each successful referral they send our way.
* Execution: Reach out to key decision-makers with a simple campaign of targeted emails and follow-up phone calls.
2. Direct Sales with a Personal Touch
* Objective: Turn interested seniors into clients through a personal and memorable sales process.
* Method: Use targeted lead lists to connect with potential clients via email and special mailings.
* Execution: Send a physical "wow box" to make a great impression, then follow up with calls and visits to build rapport and close deals.
3. Online Authority
* Objective: Become the most trusted online source for information about home inheritance.
* Method: Combine paid online advertising with efforts to improve our search engine ranking (SEO).
* Execution: Create helpful content that answers key questions, building trust and generating organic leads from our website.
4. Community Engagement
* Objective: Build a referral network from within the communities we serve.
* Method: Host events at senior communities to provide value and build relationships.
* Execution: Recruit influential residents to act as "community ambassadors" who can refer their peers and neighbors.
