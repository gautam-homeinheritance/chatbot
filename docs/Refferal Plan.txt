* Direct Outreach:
   * Identify top-performing agents specializing in senior home sales.
   * Cold email/call introducing the referral program.
   * Attend real estate networking events and industry conferences.

Message to Real Estate Agents:
Hey [Agent’s Name],
We’re launching in about three to six months, and we’d love for you to be among the first to offer our service as an option to your senior clients. HomeInheriT is like a senior-friendly HELOC, but without debt or compound interest. It helps seniors unlock their home equity while keeping their home.
This benefits you by ensuring future listing rights (which will be signed) and a $3,000 referral fee for each client who signs up. We believe this will be a win-win for both you and your clients.
