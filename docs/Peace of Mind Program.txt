Peace of Mind Program
WHAT IT IS
One time payment to you and you cover HOA dues, property taxes, homeowners insurance (base policy that emeets fund standards) of that senior for their life. We provide their life expectancy data.
WHY WE NEED IT
So seniors never lapse on HOA, property taxes, or homeowners insurance. Ensuring the home is never taken by the government, or a disaster happens and the home is not insured. Protecting the homeowner and our collateral for our fund.
Lapses on taxes/insurance/HOA can trigger liens, penalties, and uninsured losses.
A prepaid, lifetime set-aside removes payment risk and stabilizes the asset.
The money comes from our fund in exchange for a slice of the senior´s remainder interest equity.

* Disbursement: Automated, direct-to-payee (HOA / Tax Collector / Insurer).
