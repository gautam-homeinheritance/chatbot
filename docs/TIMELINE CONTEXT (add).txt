Seven-Month Runway (Nov 15 – Jun 15, 2026)
Available budget: ~$300,000
Goal: Reach $5M in investor commitments to unlock seed-round clause
Clause:
   * Unlocks $200,000 upon reaching $5M in fund commitments**

   * This extends operational runway and covers post-launch scale efforts

Funding mechanics:
      * You can draw slightly more from existing seed if needed, proportionally to progress

      * Plan to spend full $300,000 across this seven-month sprint; cash management is key

Revenue Activation
Trigger: Every $100,000 raised through tokens
Management Fee:
         * 2% annual management fee

         * After commissions: ~1% effective net inflow to company

Cash Impact:
            * For each $1M raised → ~$10,000 in annual management fee inflow

            * Modest early, but provides working capital to extend runway

Expectation:
               * Some early inflows before full $5M milestone

               * Full $200K unlock + cumulative fees will bridge toward next capital raise
               * Revenue Mechanics After Fund Launch
Once the fund capital is in motion (post-$5M commitments or earlier if partial), the company transitions from setup to transaction mode — deploying capital into senior deals and activating real revenue.

Deployment & Transaction Scale
Initial Capital Available for Transactions: ~$3,000,000
This is the practical working amount to start closing remainder-interest deals and generating realized value per transaction.
Typical Senior Transaction:
                  * Average draw: $100,000–$150,000

                  * Average deal size (home value): ~$200,000+ remainder exposure

                  * Average company net: ~$10,000 per customer (after cost & fund splits)

That means at $3M deployed, you can transact with roughly 20–30 seniors in the first cycle — generating $200,000–$300,000 in direct company revenue and proving full cycle execution.
