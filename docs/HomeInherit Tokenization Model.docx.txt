HomeInherit Tokenization Model: A Technical Overview
Our tokenization model is designed to create a liquid, transparent, and institutionally-compliant representation of an illiquid asset class—residential remainder interests. We achieve this by structuring our fund as an open-ended, evergreen vehicle powered by a hybrid on-chain and off-chain architecture.
The HI Token: The HI token is a digital security representing a direct, proportional share of the fund's Net Asset Value (NAV). It is built on the ERC-3643 standard to enforce compliance at the token level, ensuring that only whitelisted, accredited investors can hold or receive it. The token’s value is derived solely from the NAV per share and is not subject to speculative market forces outside of a secondary market.
NAV Calculation & The Oracle: To ensure institutional trust and remove conflicts of interest, the official NAV is calculated periodically (e.g., quarterly) by a third-party Fund Administrator. This administrator performs the fund accounting and valuation based on real-world data. The final, audited NAV is then delivered on-chain through a Chainlink oracle, which posts the value to our NAVOracle.sol smart contract. This process separates the complex off-chain calculation from the transparent on-chain attestation.
Value Accrual Engine: The NAV, and therefore the HI token's value, increases through two primary mechanisms:
1. Periodic Revaluation: At each calculation period, the value of our portfolio of remainder interest contracts is "marked-to-model." The value increases due to Actuarial Accretion (the time-value of money, as the liquidation event draws nearer) and Real Estate Appreciation of the underlying properties. This provides steady, predictable NAV growth.
2. Asset Liquidation: Upon the sale of a property, the full net profit (Sale Price - Capital Deployed) is realized as cash within the fund, causing a significant, one-time increase in the NAV.
Capital Flow & Onboarding: The entire investor onboarding and capital subscription process is handled by a licensed Broker-Dealer. They are responsible for KYC/AML, accredited investor verification, and processing all investment transactions. This de-risks our operation and ensures full compliance. Capital flows from the investor, through the broker-dealer, and into the fund's Qualified Custodian. Our smart contracts then mint tokens to the investor's wallet based on API triggers from the broker-dealer. This is a "Commitment and Capital Call" model, where capital is only brought into the fund when there are assets ready to be acquired.
Asset Transparency: To provide radical transparency, each remainder interest contract acquired by the fund is represented as a unique NFT held in the fund's on-chain vault. The metadata of this NFT contains anonymized, verifiable data about the underlying asset (location, type, valuation), allowing investors to audit the fund's portfolio composition in real-time.
