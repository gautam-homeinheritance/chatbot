HIToken Flow (Investment in HITCapital)
Investor → NAV Fund Admin  → BitGo Escrow (capital pool) → Senior Draws → Lady Bird Deed Filed (remainder interest in exchange of $) → Home Sold → Escrow → Fund & Heirs
Peace of Mind Program
Senior Draws → BitGo Escrow → Our system (or BitGo's determines where and when the money goes to pay the bills) → BitGo has to make those payments for the senior’s life.


INVESTOR CASH TO ESCROW
We issue shares for the fund representing ownership
10,000,000 shares
$10,000,000
Investor signs Subscription Agreement 
NAV sends order for our system to create ERC to tokenize the shares, we tell BitGo who owns them (BitGo owns shares in the name of the investor)
Either pays whole amount and we hold it in escrow (BitGo)
Or pays an initial capital call of 10%
That money also sits in BitGo’s escrow as our capital pool and money is only withdrawn to buy home inheritances or pay our 2% management fee.
________________


FROM ESCROW TO DEPLOYMENT (CASH GOES TO SENIOR)
Senior taps request money (ex $50,000)
We determine what % of remainder interest that is worth.
(When a senior draws, our CRM updates ownership % in real-time.)
(Each withdrawal = increased remainder interest allocation to the Fund.)

investor proceeds follow a capital call model (only drawn when assets are acquired) and all cash sits in regulated escrow until deployment or held in tvbills or vehicle desired by the investor.
Lets say 10%
Senior taps agree on phone (backed by Senior Master Agreement already signed)
Senior receives $50,000 from escrow
Propy e-files a remainder interest deed so now the fund owns 10% of the seniors remainder interest.
We fill up the escrow account w more capital calls.
________________


HOME SALE AFTER SENIOR PASSES
We detect death event. (flags in our sistem)
Home sells for $1,200,000
Title goes to Propy’s escrow?
From remainder interest deed.
KEY TO CHECK THIS WITH NOEL
Propy assigns us as broker to sell home.(As per Successor Manager Agreement w Propy)
Vesting schedule at closing
1 Closing Fees are first paid. (ex $50,000)
From the $1,150,000 remaining. the senior spent 10% of remainder interest.
1. Homeinherit Capital gets paid based on our transaction history with the senior, auditable. Gets 10% of $1,150,000
2. Senior’s Heirs get 90% of $1,150,000 cap table for what is left
________________

Redemptions
1. 4 year lock up 
2. Years 4-8 = 4% NAV fee for early withdrawal. 
3. Redemptions at NAV after 8 years.
Redemptions will be distributed pro rata based on the requested amount per investor. 
Redemptions are funded through home sales proceeds in that 6-month window and up to 30% of new investor capital coming in those 6 months, maintaining structured liquidity and portfolio growth.

PEACE OF MIND PROGRAM
Each senior funds a Peace of Mind Account at onboarding, a prepaid lifetime reserve designed to ensure that all property taxes, insurance premiums, and HOA dues are paid on time, for their life.
How It Works
1. Funding:

The senior pays this for the program. These funds come directly from a remainder interest transaction with us.

 (Annual Taxes + Insurance + HOA) × (Life Expectancy + 1-Year Safety Margin).
Custody:
 The total amount is deposited into a restricted sub-account under our qualified custodian (BitGo), titled to the senior and fully segregated from general fund assets.

   2. Administration:
 Although the funds are custodied by BitGo, HomeInherit administers the payments.
We route payments directly to the right parties. County Tax Collector, Insurance Broker, or HOA, removing any senior involvement.

   3. Automation & Controls:
 • Payments are scheduled automatically via API and verified in our CRM.
• Smart contract and backend automation ensure timely execution.
• If automation fails, we issue ACH or wire instructions manually.
• All transactions are recorded and auditable.

   4. Interest & Protection:
 • Funds are held in low-risk instruments (T-Bills).
• All accrued interest remains account.
• If a senior outlives their reserve, coverage continues from the shared Peace of Mind Pool, ensuring zero lapse.

The senior never worries about missing a tax, insurance, or HOA payment. 
The property stays protected. The fund’s collateral stays secure.
It’s a prepaid, lifetime insurance against uncertainty, handled by us, custodied safely, and fully automated.
