Looking for Alternative Real Estate? Choose Better, Not Different
High Returns with Lower Risk
HomeInherit Capital reshapes how real estate fits in a modern portfolio. While most real estate investments involve operational burdens and market-tied volatility, our model delivers projected returns of 13.6%, with lower downside deviation (8.03%) and a Sortino ratio of 1.3.
This is not a better version of traditional real estate. It is a structurally different asset class. Our model eliminates the typical risks of being a landlord and replaces them with decorrelated, actuarially-driven returns.
Homeinherit as an Alternative Real Estate Strategy
Institutional investors and family offices typically allocate 5 to 10 percent of their portfolios to alternatives. The goal is clear: find yield, reduce correlation, and improve portfolio efficiency. But many real estate strategies fall short. They are operationally heavy, tied to market cycles, and increasingly regulated.
HomeInherit Capital was built to solve for this. We offer a new path to access residential real estate without operational drag, without exposure to rent caps, and without dependence on tenant income. Our returns are designed to be stable, and backed by hard assets. This is real estate restructured for allocators who need passive exposure, predictable performance, and a non-correlated return stream.
Deconstructing Traditional Real Estate Risk
Most real estate investments suffer from the same problems:
* Exposure to economic cycles
* Rent dependency and tenant risk
* Maintenance and operational drag
* Regulatory pressure including rent control and zoning restrictions
HomeInherit solves all of these structurally:
1. Actuarial Based Decorrelation
Our core returns are not tied to economic cycles. Instead, they come from demographics, specifically the timing of life events in a diversified pool of U.S. seniors.
This actuarial foundation results in predictable, independent return flows that do not move with interest rates, stocks, bonds, or broader housing sentiment. This makes our fund a true diversifier for modern portfolios.
2. No Landlord Risk
Our structure has no tenants, no leases, no rent. We avoid all the risks associated with property operations including maintenance and eviction.
Seniors remain in their homes, responsible for all expenses. The Fund is not exposed to the cost or complexity of managing property.
The Return Engine: Clear, Quantifiable, Multi Factor
Our projected 13.6 percent IRR is driven by three key sources:
9.1 Percent Actuarial Alpha
Our baseline return comes from a diversified portfolio of remainder interests priced through a proprietary actuarial model using U.S. government data.
* In a Monte Carlo simulation of 50,000 assets, the average IRR was 9.1 percent, assuming 0 percent appreciation.
* Our senior demographic is statistically likely to outperform these models due to socioeconomic trends, hinting at upside potential.
3.0 Percent Home Appreciation
We target undervalued suburban homes in South Florida (Boca to Miami), where demand is rising due to inbound migration.
* Even with a severe 4 percent annual downturn, our model projects positive returns above 8 percent.
* The current geographic exposure is strategic and temporary. We plan to expand to additional appreciating U.S. markets.
1.5 Percent Strategic Home Improvements
We co-invest with homeowners to modernize and upgrade their homes. They contribute labor or equity, and we provide capital.
* They receive 50 percent of added value.
* We improve our future sale price and encourage strong upkeep at no cost to the Fund.
* In select cases, improvements could generate a plus 2.85 percent IRR boost.
Better for Seniors. Better for Investors.
We serve seniors by improving liquidity without debt or forcing them to move. That trust translates into better deal flow and long-term reputation advantages.
For investors, this model offers:
* No rent risk
* No operational overhead
* No rent caps
* Non correlation to public markets
* Access to a new, passive real estate asset class
