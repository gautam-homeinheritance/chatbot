Why We Are A Security
An investment in HomeInherit Capital Fund I, LLC (the “Fund”) constitutes an "investment contract" and is therefore classified as a security under U.S. federal and state securities laws. This determination is based on a long-standing U.S. Supreme Court case that established a four-part legal standard known as the Howey Test.
Understanding this classification is important as it explains why we provide this detailed Private Placement Memorandum and adhere to specific regulations designed to protect investors.
Here is how an investment in the Fund meets each of the four criteria of the Howey Test:
1. An Investment of Money An investor contributes capital to the Fund through a binding Capital Commitment, which is then drawn down via Capital Calls. This is a direct investment of money.
2. In a Common Enterprise All investor capital is pooled together within the Fund. The financial success of each investor is directly tied to the performance of the Fund as a whole and the portfolio of remainder interests it acquires. This shared venture, where fortunes are interwoven, is a common enterprise.
3. With an Expectation of Profits Investors contribute capital with the explicit goal of generating a financial return, as outlined in this memorandum's "Investment Objective" and detailed in the "Distribution Waterfall." The entire structure is designed to produce and distribute profits.
4. Derived Solely from the Efforts of the Promoter or a Third Party This is the most critical element for a managed fund. As a Limited Partner in the Fund, you are a passive investor. You rely exclusively on the professional expertise, active management, and dedicated efforts of HomeInherit Management, LLC (the "Manager") to execute the investment strategy. The Manager is responsible for all critical activities, including:
* Sourcing, underwriting, and acquiring all remainder interests.
* Managing the Fund's assets and operations.
* Overseeing the disposition of properties to realize value.
Your returns are generated by our work, not your own.
Conclusion
Because an investment in the Fund meets all four of these criteria, the membership interests are securities. This requires us to operate with the highest degree of transparency and to comply with the securities laws and regulations that govern private offerings, including the requirement to offer these securities only to accredited investors.
