Accessing Home Equity in Later Life: Unmet Demand and Barriers for U.S. Seniors
Many American seniors are “house rich but cash poor,” meaning they own valuable homes but have limited income or savings. Tapping into home equity could help fund retirement or healthcare, yet most older adults hesitate to do so. This report explores how many seniors (roughly age 68 and up) need or want to access home equity, how few actually do, the reasons behind their reluctance, recent trends in attitudes, and the demographic factors at play.
1. Extent of Need for Home Equity Access Among Older Seniors
Many U.S. seniors have significant wealth in their homes but insufficient cash flow for expenses, indicating a potential need to tap home equity. Homeownership is high in this age group – about 79% of Americans over 65 are homeowners , and the median home equity for a 65+ homeowner is around $250,000 (nearly 50% higher than before the pandemic) . At the same time, a large share struggle financially:
        •        11.2 million older adult households (65+) spent over 30% of their income on housing in 2021, classifying them as housing “cost-burdened” . Such fixed costs strain their budgets, suggesting these seniors might need additional funds (for example, by tapping home equity) to make ends meet.
        •        The problem is especially acute for the oldest seniors and those facing healthcare needs. In 2022, fewer than 15% of adults age 75+ could afford both their housing and necessary long-term care services, meaning 85% could not cover these costs out of income alone . For many, the house is the only substantial asset available to fill this gap.
Research shows a substantial number of seniors are indeed “asset rich and income poor.” A Brookings analysis of federal data found that more than 6 million homeowners age 62+ had less than $10,000 in non-housing financial wealth but at least $20,000 in home equity . In other words, millions of older Americans have a lot of wealth tied up in their home equity while having very little in savings – a strong indicator that they need to tap that equity for retirement security. Moreover, many might want to use this wealth but find it hard to access: as many as one in three homeowners age 62+ may not qualify for traditional home equity loans due to insufficient income or credit, “even if they wanted to” borrow against their house . This creates a population of seniors who could benefit from equity-based financial tools but aren’t using them.
Surveys of older homeowners confirm that a latent demand exists. About 37% of homeowners over 55 are concerned about their finances in retirement (that figure rises to 43% among those still carrying a mortgage) . These worries indicate a desire for additional financial resources – potentially through home equity – to support their retirement, medical bills, or aging-in-place needs. In fact, with the large baby boomer cohort now retiring (many with less savings and more debt than previous generations), experts project that “demand for equity extraction may increase” in the coming years . Simply put, a significant share of seniors want or need to tap into home equity to fund their retirement or healthcare – potentially on the order of several million households – yet most have not done so due to various barriers.
2. Actual Usage of Home Equity Products by Seniors (68+)
Despite the evident need, the rate of actually tapping home equity among seniors remains very low. The vast majority of older Americans do not use financial products like reverse mortgages or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to draw on their housing wealth. Some key metrics:
        •        Reverse mortgages (Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, or HECMs): This is a primary tool designed for seniors (available from age 62) to access home equity. However, uptake is minimal. Cumulatively, only about 1.3 million older homeowners have taken out a reverse mortgage since 1990 . That is a tiny fraction of the eligible population – in fact, recent analyses show fewer than 2% of Americans age 62+ currently have an active reverse mortgage . Another study noted the share of eligible seniors using a reverse mortgage is “well under one percent” in any given year . In practical terms, tens of millions could potentially benefit, but only a couple percent ever do. Even among homeowners who are financially constrained, reverse mortgages tend to be a last resort; for example, one study found that just 1 in 10 seniors who cannot afford senior care would even investigate a reverse mortgage as a solution (indicating 90% would look to other means first). This underscores how uncommon it is for older adults to actually leverage their home equity through a reverse mortgage.
        •        Home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs): Traditional home equity loans or credit lines require monthly payments and underwriting based on income, which can be challenging for retirees. Usage of these among the 68+ demographic is also modest. For context, in 2018 there were only about 48,000 HECM reverse mortgages originated nationwide . By comparison, that same year saw 1.12 million HELOCs and nearly 1.1 million cash-out refinance loans made in the U.S. . The vast majority of those standard equity loans skew toward younger borrowers – older homeowners are much less likely to take on a new home equity loan. In surveys, only around 16% of older homeowners say they would even prefer a home equity loan or line of credit if they needed to extract cash, while nearly half instead favor selling the home to downsize (avoiding debt) . This preference is reflected in relatively low HELOC usage rates among seniors (exact percentages are hard to find, but clearly much lower than the usage among middle-aged homeowners).
        •        Overall home equity borrowing: Many seniors do carry mortgage debt from earlier in life (or even new mortgages from refinancing), but few actively borrow additional funds against equity in later life. Even including those who refinance or take second mortgages, the share is limited. As of 2022, about 30% of homeowners age 75+ still have an outstanding mortgage (up from just 10% in 1998) , showing that more seniors are entering retirement with debt. But most of this is carry-over debt, not new borrowing for cash – and it means 70% of oldest homeowners have no mortgage and haven’t tapped their equity. All told, the financial tools specifically meant to unlock home equity (reverse mortgages, HELOCs, etc.) remain under-utilized. One industry assessment summed it up: despite a “large potential market,” the take-up of reverse mortgages is “very low” in the U.S., at only ~2% of eligible seniors . The overwhelming majority of older Americans’ home equity thus stays untapped.
3. Barriers: Why Seniors Avoid Tapping Home Equity (Behavioral Factors)
Several behavioral and psychological factors explain why so many seniors who could use their home equity choose not to do so. These include a strong aversion to debt, fears about risks, and misconceptions or lack of understanding of the products. Key barriers identified by research and surveys are:
        •        Debt Aversion and Bequest Motives: Older Americans often have a deep-seated reluctance to take on debt in retirement. They tend to be financially conservative and view a paid-off home as security. In one national survey, 80% of homeowners age 55+ said they were “not at all interested” in tapping their home equity, and another 10% were “not very interested,” leaving only a tiny fraction open to it . The most common reason given is not wanting to owe money: among those uninterested in borrowing against their house, 37% said they simply “don’t want to have the debt.” Many seniors also express a desire to leave their home equity intact as a legacy for their children/heirs or to save it for a true emergency, rather than spend it now . This bequest motive and “save it for a rainy day” mindset lead them to avoid products that would reduce their home equity.
        •        Fear of Losing the Home or Getting Scammed: There is often fear and mistrust around home equity products, especially reverse mortgages. Some older homeowners worry that if they take a reverse mortgage, they could somehow lose their house. Although HECM reverse mortgages allow the senior to stay in their home for life (as long as taxes and upkeep are paid), the perception of risk remains. Additionally, many seniors voice concern about fraud or scams targeting the elderly. In fact, among those familiar with reverse mortgages, the number one cited concern is “fear of getting scammed.” About 20% of seniors who know about reverse mortgages cite scam fears as a major reason for avoiding them . This reflects the negative reputation these products developed in the past due to predatory lenders or confusing terms. Even legitimate reverse mortgages carry technical rules (for example, requirements to maintain the home and pay property taxes) that, if misunderstood, could lead to foreclosure – seniors may find these rules daunting and err on the side of caution.
        •        Lack of Understanding and Misinformation: Financial literacy around home equity products is low among seniors. Many do not fully understand how reverse mortgages or HELOCs work, or they overestimate the downsides. Studies have found that reverse mortgages are complex financial products and households have difficulty assessing their true costs and benefits . For example, some believe the bank will own their home or that debt will balloon uncontrollably – which is not exactly the case (the borrower retains title and loans are non-recourse). Nonetheless, such misconceptions persist. In one survey, roughly half of older homeowners said they were familiar with reverse mortgages, yet only 6% said they would ever prefer a reverse mortgage if they needed cash . High upfront fees associated with reverse mortgages also create a perception that they are not worth the cost. Even when the insurance protections and long-term benefits might make sense, seniors tend to overestimate the costs and risks while underestimating the potential benefits . Inadequate professional advice compounds this: many financial advisors either don’t bring up home equity or are themselves unsure about these products. Nearly 90% of older adults with advisors said their advisor never mentioned home equity options, leading seniors to assume it must not be a good idea . This lack of guidance and understanding keeps adoption low.
        •        Psychological Attachment and Stigma: Owning a home free and clear is often a point of pride. Taking a loan against the house can feel like a failure or a risk to independence for some elders. There can be a stigma or emotional hurdle in using what has traditionally been seen as a “last resort” option. Many remember relatives warning against “putting your house at risk,” and thus they shy away from the very idea of borrowing in old age. Surveys find older generations far less open to home equity borrowing than younger people – for instance, 94% of the Silent Generation (age ~80+) and 89% of Baby Boomers said they’re unlikely to use home equity loans in retirement . This highlights a cultural mindset among today’s seniors that tapping home equity (beyond maybe selling the home) is something to avoid.
In summary, conservative financial attitudes, fear of debt and scams, and limited understanding of home equity products create a significant psychological barrier. These factors explain why even seniors who objectively need extra money often do not utilize the equity in their homes. As one study concluded, these attitudes result in persistently high levels of untapped home wealth . Overcoming myths and educating seniors (and their advisors) about safe ways to use home equity is a challenge that persists.
4. Trends in Attitudes and Needs (Past 5–10 Years)
Over the last decade, the landscape for senior home equity and retirement needs has been evolving, though the core attitudes have been slow to change. Here are some notable trends and shifts from roughly the mid-2010s to the mid-2020s:
        •        Rising Home Equity and Retirement Wealth Gap: Home values have increased substantially in recent years, boosting seniors’ equity. The median home equity for 65+ homeowners rose by ~47% from 2019 to 2022 (from ~$170k to $250k) thanks to surging real estate prices. Collectively, Americans over 62 now hold over $12 trillion in home equity wealth (as of 2023) – a record high . This means the potential resource to tap is larger than ever. At the same time, other retirement resources have not kept up for many. The gap between those with pensions/savings and those without is widening. For lower-income seniors especially, housing wealth now constitutes a bigger share of their net worth. (Older homeowners in the lowest income quartile had a median of $115,000 in home equity – fully 67% of their total assets .) This trend implies that the need to leverage home equity for support could be increasing, as more retirees have most of their wealth in the house and relatively little in 401(k)s or savings.
        •        Increasing Senior Mortgage Debt: Unlike previous generations who often burned their mortgage papers by retirement, recent seniors are more likely to carry mortgage debt into older age. The share of homeowners age 75+ with an outstanding mortgage almost tripled from 10.9% in 1998 to about 30% in 2022 . Even among those 65–74, over 38% had mortgages in 2022 (up from 29% in 1998) . This trend has accelerated in the past 5–10 years with waves of refinancing (especially during the low interest rates of 2020–2021) and people buying later in life. Consequently, more seniors today have mandatory housing payments in retirement, which could increase financial pressure. Needing to service debt might make some more open to solutions like reverse mortgages (which can pay off an existing mortgage and eliminate monthly payments). However, it’s a double-edged sword: those with mortgages are also the ones who have already tapped some equity or have less remaining equity to draw, and they tend to be more financially strained. Indeed, 40% of homeowners 62+ with a mortgage are cost-burdened by housing costs , much higher than the 24% of same-age homeowners who are mortgage-free and cost-burdened . The rising prevalence of debt has slightly increased awareness of home equity options, but many still do not take the next step to borrow more in retirement.
        •        Stagnant or Slightly Shifting Attitudes: Surveys in the past few years echo the same caution seen a decade ago, with only minor shifts. Around 2016–2017, Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey found about 90% of older homeowners were not interested in tapping equity – and by 2022, a Harris poll similarly found over 90% of older Americans still unlikely to consider a home equity product . The needle has moved only marginally. One change is generational turnover: as younger Baby Boomers (more comfortable with debt) replace the Silent Generation, interest in tapping equity has ticked up a bit. For example, 11% of Boomers in one survey said they might consider using home equity, versus only 6% of their parents’ generation . Likewise, familiarity with reverse mortgages has grown (about half of seniors say they know what a reverse mortgage is, compared to less awareness in the past) . But familiarity has not translated to favorability. Negative perceptions remain entrenched. Over the last 5 years, public agencies and nonprofits (HUD, CFPB, AARP, etc.) have increased education efforts about reverse mortgages – for instance, mandatory counseling for borrowers and campaigns to improve financial literacy – yet usage has not dramatically increased. In sum, the attitudinal trend is one of slow change: younger retirees might be slightly more open to the idea of leveraging home equity, but an overwhelming majority in 2025 still prefer to avoid it if possible.
        •        Reverse Mortgage Market Trends: The reverse mortgage industry experienced a boom-and-bust cycle over the past 10–15 years. After peaking at around 114,000 HECM loans in 2009 (just after the financial crisis), annual volumes dropped significantly in the mid-2010s due to tighter regulations and reputational issues. In the late 2010s, volumes stabilized around 40–50,000 loans per year . The last few years have seen some renewed interest: during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021), with interest rates at historic lows and home values high, more seniors found reverse mortgages attractive as a lifeline (some media dubbed it a “lifeline during coronavirus” as cash-strapped retirees sought relief). By FY 2022–2023, HECM endorsements ticked upward again. HUD reported about 64,000 reverse mortgage endorsements in FY 2022 and a slightly higher count in 2023, marking the best numbers in a decade (though still well below the 2009 peak) . Industry analysts describe the market as having “regained some popularity in recent years” , but it remains a niche. Meanwhile, alternative equity-tapping products (like home equity investment contracts) have emerged, though these are even less common. Overall, over the past 5–10 years, the need for home equity solutions has grown (with more seniors facing financial shortfalls), but adoption has only inched up slightly. The fundamental attitudes of caution are proving slow to shift, despite greater awareness. The coming years will show if the retirement income shortfalls of the boomer generation force a more significant change in leveraging home equity.
5. Demographic Factors Affecting Home Equity Access
Not all seniors are alike in their approach to home equity. Demographic differences – such as income level, gender, homeownership status, and race/ethnicity – influence both the need to tap home equity and the likelihood of doing so. Below are some key breakdowns:
        •        Income and Financial Status: Lower-income seniors (who often have limited retirement savings) are the ones most in need of accessing home equity, and indeed they are more represented among reverse mortgage users. Reverse mortgage borrowers have incomes about 40% lower than the median income of other seniors on average . They tend to be “cash poor” – often the mortgage is a way to supplement Social Security. In contrast, higher-income retirees usually have other assets or income streams and are less likely to consider tapping home equity (they don’t need to, or they can downsize on their own terms). It’s important to note that homeownership itself varies by income: many very low-income elders do not own homes at all (they rent and thus have no home equity to tap). Those low-income folks who do own a home typically purchased it long ago or inherited it, and for them the home can represent the bulk of their net worth. For example, older homeowners in the lowest income quartile have a median home equity of $115,000, which constitutes 67% of their total assets . This means tapping that equity could significantly improve their finances. However, traditional equity loans may be out of reach for them (due to insufficient income to qualify), leaving reverse mortgages or property tax deferrals as possible tools. Middle-income seniors with moderate homes are another key group – they often need extra money for things like medical expenses, and home equity could be a solution if they overcome the fears discussed. In summary, the lower a senior’s income (or liquid assets), the more likely they need to use home equity – and indeed lower-income, cash-strapped homeowners make up a large share of those who actually do take out reverse mortgages .
        •        Homeownership and Housing Wealth: Simply having home equity is a prerequisite to tapping it – and homeownership rates differ across demographics. Overall, as noted, nearly 80% of seniors 65+ own homes , but this masks differences: homeownership is above 80% for white and higher-income seniors, and lower (60–70%) for Black, Hispanic, and lower-income seniors . Those without a home cannot tap equity (though they may face the greatest financial needs, they must rely on other support). Among homeowners, the amount of equity matters too – some seniors still carry a mortgage or live in areas with low property values, so the equity available might be modest. For instance, Black senior homeowners have a median home equity of around $123,000 versus $251,000 for white senior homeowners . Smaller equity might not be worth tapping after costs. On the other end, those with very high-value homes might not need to tap equity (they often have other wealth), or they might use upscale tools like jumbo/proprietary reverse mortgages. In general, homeowners with substantial equity but insufficient other savings (often middle-class retirees) form the demographic most likely to consider equity extraction – they have something to tap and a reason to tap it.
        •        Gender: There are notable gender dynamics in home equity usage. Women tend to live longer than men and are more likely to be widowed, living alone on a fixed income. As a result, older single women are disproportionately among those who tap home equity for support. Households headed by women are more likely to obtain reverse mortgages than those headed by men . Industry data shows that among HECM borrowers, about 39% are single female borrowers, compared to only ~21% single male borrowers (the rest are couples) . The typical profile of a reverse mortgage borrower is often a widow in her early 70s. Women may have lower average Social Security benefits (due to shorter work histories or lower wages) and often face higher medical or long-term care costs in very old age. Home equity can thus be a crucial resource for older women. That said, women also tend to be more cautious about financial decisions. Some studies suggest older women are more risk-averse and may be hesitant to take on a loan without extensive advice – but when they do seek help, it’s often because they truly need income. Men, on average, might be slightly more willing to consider financial maneuvers like refinancing, but the data shows fewer older men living alone end up with reverse mortgages (perhaps because men are more likely to have a spouse to share expenses or they pass away earlier, leaving the widow to handle finances later). In summary, gender plays a role: elderly women (especially single/widowed) are both more likely to need home equity for financial stability and indeed form a large segment of those who utilize reverse mortgages .
        •        Race and Ethnicity: Economic disparities by race extend into retirement years and affect home equity situations. Older Black and Latino homeowners typically have much lower non-housing wealth than their white counterparts, making them more “house rich, cash poor.” For example, the median liquid assets of Black homeowners age 62+ is only about $3,580, and for Hispanic homeowners about $6,200, compared to $16,270 for white homeowners of the same age . They also have lower median home equity (around $200k for older Hispanic and $123k for older Black homeowners, versus $251k for older white homeowners) . This means minority seniors often rely heavily on their home as their main source of wealth. One might expect this would lead to higher use of equity extraction. However, usage remains relatively low in these groups as well – likely due to access barriers and mistrust. In fact, minority seniors are more likely to be cost-burdened by housing (over half of older Black homeowners pay >30% of income on housing, vs about 38% of older white homeowners) , which indicates acute need. But historically, reverse mortgage uptake among African-American and Latino seniors has been only somewhat proportional to their share of homeowners. (Some studies in the 2000s did find African-Americans were slightly overrepresented among reverse mortgage borrowers relative to their share of the senior population, possibly because of greater need and targeted marketing in some urban areas. Still, trust in financial institutions is an issue; negative experiences or lack of awareness may limit participation.) Culturally, some minority families may prefer multigenerational solutions – e.g. adult children supporting parents – rather than parents borrowing against the home. Demographically, older Black and Hispanic homeowners stand to benefit greatly from easier access to home equity (given their low incomes and asset levels), but extra efforts may be required to overcome distrust and ensure products meet their needs. On the other hand, white and Asian seniors, who on average have more assets, might choose to tap equity more as a strategic choice rather than a desperate need. Policymakers note that expanding home equity access (through better programs or counseling) could especially help minority seniors who have high homeownership rates but low retirement incomes .
In summary, seniors most likely to seek home equity access are those with high homeownership and equity but low other resources – often lower-income, older women, and homeowners of color with limited savings. Meanwhile, those less likely to use it tend to be higher-income, or conversely the very poor who don’t own homes. Understanding these demographic patterns is important for targeting education and policy solutions. For instance, special outreach might be needed for widows or for financially strained minority communities to explain options like reverse mortgages in a trustworthy way. And as noted, homeownership itself is a key factor – roughly one-fifth of seniors don’t own homes at all , and for them the policy focus would need to be on other forms of support, since home equity access is not an option.
