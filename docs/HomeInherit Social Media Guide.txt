🧩 Core Post Types
1. Explainers
Answer one real question per post.
   * “Is this a loan?” → No. You don’t owe anything back. You’re trading equity for cash.

   * “What happens when the senior passes?” → The house is sold. What they didn’t spend goes to the heirs.

   * “Will I pay taxes?” → No. The home’s value steps up when you pass. No capital gains for your heirs.

   * “What if I live to 105?” → The card keeps working. You stay in your home.

2. Concept Snapshots
Short posts (30–60 words) that teach the model.
A $900K home.
The senior uses $200K.
They still own the rest.
When they pass, their kids inherit it—tax-free.
Every swipe of the card is a trade:
Cash now for future equity.
Spend more, own less.
Spend less, pass more to your family.

4. "What If…" Posts
Use real-life skepticism.
      * “What if the house needs repairs?”


We check it every 15 months. Big repairs come from the equity, keeping the home’s value strong.


      * “What if I only want $20,000?”


That’s fine. You only give up what you use. Everything else stays yours.

5. Money Scenarios
         * A $700K home.
The senior uses $150K.
Ten years later, the house sells for $950K.
The family inherits $800K.


No debt. No interest. No tax.


         * A $1M house.
The senior uses $100K over 7 years.
The home appreciates to $1.2M.
Their family keeps $1.1M, tax-free.

6. Tax Law Simplified
            * IRC §1014: The home’s value resets to market value at death.
→ No capital gains for your heirs.

            * IRC §121(d)(8): You can sell your remainder interest without losing your home’s tax protections.
→ Seniors still get their $250K/$500K exclusions.

7. Mindset Posts
               * You shouldn’t have to borrow money to enjoy the home you already own.

               * Your home is worth a lot. That doesn’t mean you should leave it—or lose it.

               * You worked for decades. We just help you access what you earned.
