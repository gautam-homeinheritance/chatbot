HomeInherit – Peace of Mind Program (Patent Pending)
What We Do (Senior-Focused)
HomeInheriT enables seniors to unlock a portion of their future home inheritance equity value today, while staying in their home for life, guaranteed. Seniors never take on debt, never make repayments, and whatever they don’t use continues to grow and ultimately passes to their heirs tax-free.
Why We Need You – The Peace of Mind Program
We need your firm to oversee our Peace of Mind Program, funded from the future inheritance value that seniors sell to the fund. This program ensures seniors’ property costs are prepaid and protected for life.
How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Senior signs → sells a slice of their future inheritance value.

2. One-time payment calculated: (Taxes + Insurance [+ HOA if included]) × Life Expectancy.

3. Amount carved out upfront from inheritance proceeds.

4. Lump sum placed in trust/escrow, invested safely (T-bills, ladders).

5. Payments auto-disbursed for property taxes, insurance, and optional HOA.

6. Senior never touches it; heirs receive any unused funds at death.

Example Snapshot (Age ~77, Life Expectancy = 10 Years)
   * Property Taxes: $5,000/year

   * Insurance: $4,000/year

   * Annual Total = $9,000
   * Life Expectancy = 10 years
 One-Time Payment = $90,000 (funded from inheritance carve-out)

Benefits for Seniors & Heirs
      * Removes foreclosure and lien risks (if HOA is included, covers HOA foreclosure too).

      * Guarantees lifetime peace of mind.

      * Protects heirs from unpaid property bills.
Your Role
         * Oversee pooled trust/fund.

         * Hold assets in low-risk vehicles that beat inflation.

         * Run disbursements & reporting.

         * Ensure compliance and transparency.
Compensation Proposal
            * Baseline: 1% annual management fee on assets under trust.

            * No per trust set up

            * Yield spread from safe investments retained.
Could we allocate some of that money from the seniors one time payment to our Fund (hitcapital.com)  that buys the remainder interests?
