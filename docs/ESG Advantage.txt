Want to know more? Understanding the ESG Frameworks
1. How We Align with SFDR (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation)
SFDR forces funds to prove their sustainability claims. HomeInherit provides the tangible evidence your fund needs to classify its investment under a higher ESG rating.
* Article 6 Fund (No ESG focus): Investing in us provides portfolio diversification with a positive story.
* Article 8 Fund ("Light Green"): Our model promotes social characteristics. You can use our metrics (housing stability, financial inclusion) to substantiate your Article 8 classification.
* Article 9 Fund ("Dark Green"): If your fund's core objective is sustainable investment with a social goal, HomeInherit is a perfect fit. Our entire business model is a targeted social outcome, providing the necessary data for the highest SFDR classification.


2. How We Use IRIS+ to Measure What Matters
The Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) created IRIS+ so that impact can be measured like financial returns. We use these globally recognized standards to prove our model works.
