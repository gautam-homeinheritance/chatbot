'Wow-Level' Mail
Sending box with materials, call about them
Step 1: Sourcing & Budgeting Your Materials
Get samples and price quotes to determine final budget per kit.
Hire a local guy to ship them and give him a route, pay by hour.
Personalize with a note: for the Millers, or Mr/Ms Sandman… 
1. The Welcome Box (Magnetic Clasp)
* Where to Look: Search for "custom mailer boxes" or "magnetic gift boxes."
* Vendors to Explore:
   * Good: Packlane, UPrinting (Good for smaller quantities, easy online design tools).
   * Better/Best: Arka, PakFactory (Higher quality, more customization, better for larger orders).
* Estimated Price: Expect $8 - $20 per box, depending on size, quality, and quantity. Always order a sample kit first.
2. The Printed Materials (Letter & Brochure)
* Where to Look: Your local print shop is often best for seeing paper quality in person. Online, search for "premium brochure printing."
* Vendors to Explore:
   * Good/Better: Moo.com (Known for high-quality paper), Smartpress.
   * Best: A local, high-end commercial printer.
* Paper Quality: Ask for "heavy, textured, uncoated cardstock" for the letter and "heavy matte or silk paper stock" for the brochure.
* Estimated Price: Highly variable, but budget $5 - $15 per set (letter + brochure) for premium quality.
3. The Thoughtful Gift
* Where to Look: Search for "local corporate gifts" or "artisanal food gifts" in your target area (e.g., "Miami local honey corporate gift").
* Vendors to Explore:
   * Local First: Farmers' markets, local bakeries, or coffee roasters.
   * Online Curators: Greetabl, BoxFox, Knack Shops.
* Estimated Price: Keep it in the $10 - $15 range. The goal is a thoughtful gesture, not an expensive gift.
Estimated Total Materials Cost Per Kit: $23 - $50
Step 2: Assigning the Creative Work
Who will create the content that goes inside the box?
1. Writing the Letters & Brochure
* Option A (DIY): You write it. You know the voice and mission better than anyone. This is the most authentic option.
* Option C (Handwriting Service): For the personalized letter, services like Handwrytten or Scribeless use robots with real pens to create "handwritten" notes at scale. This adds a powerful touch.
2. Designing the Brochure & Box
* Option A (DIY): Use a tool like Canva. It has professional templates and is easy to use.
* Option B (Freelancer): Hire a freelance graphic designer from a site like 99designs or Behance. This will give you a more unique, polished look.
Step 3: Planning the Logistics
1. Assembly
* In-House: Your team (or your first interns) assembles the kits. This gives you full quality control. Set up an assembly line to make it efficient.
* Outsource: A "kitting and fulfillment" service can assemble and store your kits for you. This is more expensive but saves significant time as you scale.
2. Delivery
* Courier: Using a local courier service is the "wow" option. It feels personal and important.
* Premium Mail: Using FedEx or UPS is still a great option and more scalable. Ensure you use high-quality shipping boxes so the inner gift box arrives in perfect condition.
Next Steps Checklist
* Order sample boxes from 2-3 vendors.
* Select good paper and design the letter.
* Decide on the "thoughtful gift" and get pricing.
* Find 'Handwritten’ letters.
* Finalize your budget per kit.
