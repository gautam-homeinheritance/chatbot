Actors
* Senior – requests money

* Homeinherit App – front-end to request money

* CRM (Inherit) – backend of record (already built, but will need key updates to accommodate final model)

* Custodian – regulated trust bank

* Bank – senior’s destination account

* Blockchain Layer – token/NFT infrastructure + immutable reporting

Payment Flow (Step-by-Step)
   1. Senior: Opens Homeinherit App → taps Request Funds.

   2. App → CRM: Sends request payload (senior ID, amount requested).

   3. CRM (Inherit):

      * Verifies identity (KYC data already stored).

      * Confirms available balance in Senior Master Account.

      * Pulls required data:

         * Senior’s verified bank account (on file).

         * Senior’s agreement % terms.

         * Remaining equity balance.

         * Transaction history.

            4. CRM → Custodian: Issues structured payment instruction (who, how much, destination account).

            5. Custodian:

               * Confirms balance at Senior Master Account.

               * Executes ACH/wire transfer.

                  6. Bank: Funds hit senior’s account.

                  7. Custodian → CRM: Sends transaction ID + settlement confirmation.

                  8. CRM → Homeinherit App: Updates status to senior → “Your funds were deposited.”

                  9. CRM Compliance Layer (we do this):

                     * Logs transaction (amount, time, reference ID).

                     * Updates NAV + reporting feed (for audit + investors).

                        10. Blockchain Layer:

                           * NAV + transaction hash posted on-chain.

                           * Remainder interest recorded as NFT, tied to fund treasury.

                           * Investor HI Tokens updated to reflect NAV change.

Blockchain Role — What We Need to Get Done
                              * Custodian integration: Custodian must connect to blockchain to verify funds before tokens mint.

                              * Smart contract deployment: Automate mint/burn of HI Tokens + registry of NFTs.

                              * On-chain NAV updates: Push fund NAV via oracle for transparency.

                              * Immutable audit trail: Post transaction proofs on-chain for compliance and investor trust.

                              * Security review: Ensure smart contracts + API calls are fully audited before launch.
