Our 3 Return Drivers
HomeInherit Capital is designed to deliver stronger, more stable returns by combining three key drivers of value. Our strategy targets a projected 13.6 percent  return, with a projected downside deviation of 8.03 percent and a Sortino ratio of 1.3. These are not promises or guarantees, but outputs of a disciplined, data-backed model engineered to reduce risk and increase predictability.
The Three Engines Behind Our Projected Returns
1. Actuarial Alpha (Projected 9.1% IRR)
Our largest return driver comes from actuarial science. Returns are based on demographic timelines rather than economic cycles or rental income.
We use life expectancy data and conservative assumptions to forecast outcomes. Our model projects an average internal rate of return of 9.1 percent, even if home prices do not appreciate.
2. Appreciation Exposure (Estimating 3% IRR)
We invest in desirable neighborhoods in South Florida with strong demographic demand and long-term upside. While our model can perform without appreciation, we take selective, data-driven exposure to home price growth. Even under scenarios where prices decline 4 percent annually for a decade, our models still project positive net returns.
3. Property Improvements (Up to 2.85% IRR uplift)
We offer to co-invest with homeowners in optional property upgrades that can raise resale value. When completed, modernizations have shown to increase home value by as much as 14 percent. These improvements can add approximately 2.85 percent to overall returns, depending on participation.
Designed to Reduce Risk
Alongside return generation, our structure is built to manage risk at every level:
* No tenants, no landlord responsibilities
* Every property is acquired debt-free
* Returns are fundamentally uncorrelated with stock or bond markets
A Smarter Real Estate Model
We aim to offer the upside of real estate without the volatility, complexity, or operational drag of traditional models. This structure is engineered to support portfolio stability and long-term performance.
This Is a Limited Opportunity
This investment opportunity is being offered to a small group of early partners. As capacity is reached, new participation may be limited to later tranches with adjusted terms.
