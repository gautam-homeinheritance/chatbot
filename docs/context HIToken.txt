Strong ESG & Social Impact
Invest in peace of mind. A decorrelated, real-asset strategy that also delivers tangible social good.
Invest in peace of mind.
The problem
Asset-rich, cash-poor seniors. Their equity is trapped.
•
Will they be able to pay their property taxes? Their home insurance? Their medical bills? Or even the constantly raising food & living expenses?
•
This really troubles the peace of mind they should be experiencing in their retirement, enjoying the wealth they created.
•
By giving seniors liquidity on their only asset, you are also creating a great investment opportunity. We make sure it is aligned for both parties and done well.
Our solution
•
Cash, no debt. We buy a share of future value. No loans & no payments.
•
Age in place. Seniors always stay in their homes.
•
Worry-free living. We escrow funds to cover property taxes & insurance forever, removing a major stressor.
Built for trust
•
By seniors, for seniors. Founder Tom Goren (a senior) designed an ethical, durable structure and stays close to every case.
•
Culture of care. Guided by Dr. David Vik (Zappos culture coach) to ensure respect and service in every interaction.
Measurable impact
•
Financial inclusion + housing stability for a vulnerable population.
•
Reportable ESG outcomes aligned with global standards (e.g., UN SDGs).
The outcome
A decorrelated, real-asset strategy that also delivers tangible social good. Your capital doesn't just target returns, it restores security, dignity, and peace of mind for seniors.

Enhanced Liquidity
ES
Investor Friendly Liquidity & Operations. Real estate is a powerful long term investment, but it's often illiquid. We designed our fund to give you the best of both worlds.
Investor Friendly Liquidity & Operations
Real estate is a powerful long term investment, but it's often illiquid. We designed our fund to give you the best of both worlds: the stable, long term growth of real estate with a clear, structured path to liquidity.
Our evergreen structure is the key. It means the fund is always open, continuously acquiring new assets and accepting new partners. This creates a dynamic model built for both growth and flexibility.
How Our Fund Works for You
Our process is simple and designed to put your capital to work efficiently.
Capital Commitment
We issue capital calls only when a specific asset is secured, reducing idle cash and putting your money to work faster.
Instant Diversification
Because our fund is evergreen, your investment gives you immediate ownership across our entire portfolio of homes. You get the full benefit of our diversification from day one and keep growing it with each new home.
A Cycle of Growth
As our assets mature and properties are sold, the proceeds are recycled back into the fund. This capital is used to acquire new assets, creating a compounding growth effect that builds value over time.
A Worry Free Investment
Your investment is used to acquire a direct interest in a property, only when that property is acquired. If there are no deals, your capital is not at risk. This structure ties your investment directly to a secure, tangible asset, making it a more secure way to invest in real estate.
Your Path to Liquidity
Our evergreen model is what makes investor liquidity possible. We have two primary sources of cash to fund redemption requests.
1. Natural Cash Flow
The primary source of liquidity comes from the sale of properties as our investments mature. This is the natural operating cycle of the fund generating cash.
2. New Investor Capital
To provide additional flexibility, up to half of the capital from new investors can also be used to fulfill (pro rata) redemption requests from existing partners.
After an initial four year lock up period, you can request redemptions twice a year. This structure provides a clear and predictable path to access your capital, solving one of the biggest challenges of traditional real estate investing.
