Onboarding with Us
Welcome to the team! You are joining an ambitious and growing team of around 10 people at a pivotal early stage. This is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what we plan to be a globally significant company and to make a tangible impact from day one.
Our Onboarding Style 
   * Our onboarding process reflects our culture: it's fast, direct, and condensed. Instead of days of formal training, we use asynchronous communication (like audio messages) to get you the information you need efficiently.
   * This requires you to be proactive. We expect you to take notes, re-listen to instructions to ensure you understand them, and ask clarifying questions. Unless a message is marked as "urgent," you are not expected to reply immediately; you can work on tasks at your own pace.
Your First Weeks 
   * You will be tasked with key projects that are central to our company's growth.
   * You will be communicating directly with team members and leadership. Efficient and clear communication is vital for our success, as our CEO is in constant contact with the entire team to keep things moving forward.
Key Contacts & Administrative Info 
   * Diego (COO) or Susan (Executive Assistant)  will handle your offer letter and contract. He will get in touch as soon as the specifics for international team members are sorted out.
   * You will be paid every two weeks.
   * Don't hesitate to let us know if there is any other context or information you need. Open dialogue is a key part of our communication style.
