The 72-Hour Trust Campaign: 
It starts by sending a high-quality piece of physical mail to build trust, followed by a "warm call" two days later where you reference the note you sent, ensuring you don't come across as a cold caller.
Day 1: The Physical Anchor
Action: Do not call first. Send a high-quality piece of physical mail. This anchors your name to a real object, making you more than just another phone call.
* Format: An oversized postcard or a single piece of heavy cardstock in a quality envelope. Use a real stamp.
* The Message (Handwritten or looks handwritten):
"[Name],
My name is [Your Name] from HomeInherit. I'll be giving you a brief call on Wednesday to share an idea that's helping your neighbors stay in their homes for good, with no debt.
If you'd prefer to connect sooner, my number is [Your #]."
* The Psychology: You have set a professional, polite expectation for a call. You have given them control by providing your number first. The postcard is now on their kitchen counter. You are real.
Day 2: The Soft Landing
Action (Optional): If you have the address, do a quick "drive-by confirmation." Do not knock or interact. Simply confirm the house exists and appears cared for. This visual context will help you tailor your conversation.
Day 3: The Warm Call & Digital Echo
The Call
Action: Make the call you promised. Your opening is not a pitch; it's a follow-up.
   * The Script:
"Hi, may I speak with [Name]?"
(They confirm)
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] calling from HomeInherit. I sent you a quick note in the mail a couple of days ago, and I was just calling as promised to follow up. Did you happen to see it?"
   * The Psychology: You are not a random telemarketer. You are the person from the postcard. Whether they saw it or not, you have framed the call as professional and expected. You can now pivot to your core message ("Just so you know, this isn't a loan...").
The Digital Echo (If No Answer)
Action: Leave a brief voicemail and, if you have their email, send a short message.
      * Voicemail Script:
"Hi [Name], it's [Your Name] calling from HomeInherit, just following up on the note I sent. My number is [Your #]. Thanks."
      * Email:
         * Subject: Following up
         * Body: "[Name], I just tried giving you a call to follow up on the note I sent. We help homeowners access their wealth with no debt and a guarantee they stay in their home for life. Does a brief chat next week make sense?"
The Polite Exit Strategy (If They Are Not Interested)
This is a two-part process designed to gracefully end a conversation while opening the door for a referral.
1. The Referral Hint (Plant the Seed)
Before they give you a hard "no," subtly define who you're looking for. This makes them think about who they might know who fits the description.
         * The Script:
"I completely understand, and I appreciate you telling me. It sounds like this isn't the right fit for you right now.
Just so you know, what we do is typically best for folks who are settled in their home, maybe retired, and are more 'house-rich' than 'cash-rich'. They don't want to take on a new loan, but could use some extra cash to make life more comfortable."
2. The Graceful Exit (The Final "No")
If they confirm they are not interested after the hint, you exit politely, leaving a positive final impression.
            * The Script:
"Thank you so much for your time, [Name]. I really appreciate your honesty. If you ever happen to run into a neighbor or friend who fits that description I mentioned, I would be grateful if you kept us in mind. Have a wonderful day."
            * The Psychology: You were polite, you didn't pressure them, and you reinforced who you can help. You've left the door open for them to become a valuable source of referrals in the future.
