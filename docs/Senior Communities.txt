Senior Communities 
This playbook outlines a boots-on-the-ground strategy that begins by offering well-paid local job opportunities to seniors, which then serves as a trusted introduction to our homeowner seminar.
Phase 1: The Prep Work - Getting On-Site
1. Identify Target Communities: Create a list of key 55+ communities in Miami-Dade and Broward. Also other senior centers or places where seniors gather.
2. Contact Community Management: Reach out to the HOA or social committee manager. Your pitch is simple and compelling:
"We're a new South Florida company looking to hire locally, and we believe the best people for the job already live in your community. We'd like to host a 'Local Hiring' event to offer well-paid opportunities to your residents."
3. Book & Promote:
   * Reserve the community clubhouse for two separate days.
   * Promote the first event with flyers that say: "We're Hiring! A New South Florida Company is Looking for Community Partners."
Phase 2: The Two-Day Event
Day 1: The "Local Partners" Hiring Event
Your goal is to hire a small team of trusted community insiders.
   * The Event: Host a "Community Partners Info Session" with coffee and pastries in the clubhouse.
   * The Pitch:
"We're HomeInherit, and we're hiring locally. We're looking for a few sharp, respected people to work with us right here in your community. We know many seniors are struggling with rising costs, and we think this is a great, well-paid opportunity."
   * The "Crazy" Job Offer:
      * Commission: A $2,000 flat fee for every single introduction that becomes a client.
      * No Selling: "You are not a salesperson. Your only job is to make a warm introduction to your neighbors. That's it. We handle everything else."
      * Exclusivity: "We are only taking 2-3 partners in this community."
      * The Pivot & Announcement: At the end of the hiring event, you make the crucial pivot.
"Now, for everyone here and for all your neighbors, we want to show you exactly what our company does. In two days, we'll be back here to host a free educational talk...
Day 2: The "Unlock Your Inheritance" Seminar
This is the client-facing event, now promoted to a much warmer audience.
         * The Event: Host a free, one-hour seminar in the same clubhouse.
         * The Hook / Title:
"Your Inheritance is Worth a Lot of Money. Here's How to Use It—With No Risk, No Debt, and No Payments."
         * The Simple Presentation:
            1. The Problem: "Many of us are 'house-rich but cash-poor'."
            2. The Old Way: Explain the risks of debt-based loans.
            3. The New Way: Show how your "inheritance advance" works, emphasizing the three "NOs": No Debt, No Payments, No Leaving Your Home.
            * The "Ask":
"If you'd like to see what your inheritance could unlock for you, we're booking free, private 15-minute home consultations for later this week."
               *
