Vision Statement


“To provide seniors with a customer centric way to access their home inheritance equity now, while they stay in their homes for life.” HomeInherit lets seniors unlock their home equity without debt, interest, or risk, while staying in their homes for life.
What We Do
Just like startups, seniors now have access to equity-based capital, safe, transparent, and structured for long-term dignity.
Instead of taking out loans or reverse mortgages against the home, seniors sell a portion of their home’s future inheritance value in exchange for immediate access to funds. This isn’t debt, it’s equity. What they don’t use continues to grow and is passed on to their heirs, tax-free.
We price each home individually based on age, gender, location, and market appreciation. Our fund invests across a diversified portfolio of remainder interests, gaining exposure to pure home equity, without the burden of tenants, maintenance, or management.




Market Opportunity & Solution
Total Addressable Market (TAM)
The U.S. senior homeowner market represents a $10 trillion opportunity, with approximately 25 million seniors aged 70+ owning significant equity in their homes. This vast untapped market showcases the potential of leveraging home equity to meet seniors’ financial needs.


Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
Our serviceable market is estimated at $2.5 trillion, targeting the 25% of senior homeowners who are “house-rich but cash-poor.” These individuals need access to their home equity for healthcare, living expenses, and maintenance while maintaining ownership and financial independence.




Market Pain Points
        Current Solutions Are Limiting:
        Reverse mortgages and HELOCs charge high interest, reducing long-term equity.
        Lack of flexibility in selling home equity in portions. And in allowing staying at the home for life.
        Minimal inheritance left for heirs due to interest taking away most of the remaining equity.
        Untapped Potential:
        Only 5% of eligible seniors use reverse mortgages due to high costs, risk and lack of user-friendly options.
        The $10 trillion senior home equity market remains largely untapped, with significant opportunity for innovative solutions.


Incremental Access: Seniors access home equity as needed, avoiding the inefficiency of lump-sum payments. Equity usage directly translates into fractional ownership of the home by LPs.
Debt-Free, Interest-Free Solution: No interest accrues, and seniors remain debt-free as funds are deducted from their equity share.
Flexibility: Seniors retain control and can use the debit card for any expense, eliminating concerns about repayment schedules or restrictions.
Dynamic Ownership: Ownership of the home shifts incrementally to LPs in real-time as seniors spend, optimizing cash flow for the business and maximizing senior satisfaction.


Rapid Growth Model
        Seamless Onboarding: Seniors can sign up easily by providing basic details like age, marital and smoking status. With our integration to Zillow’s API, we instantly calculate the home’s current value, equity potential, and estimated future average growth.
        Immediate Access: Once they accept and sign up, seniors receive a debit card linked to their equity. This allows them to start spending their money right away, on anything they choose, while we handle ownership transfers and backend processes seamlessly.
        Quick Scalability: The streamlined onboarding process, supported by in-person or online guidance, eliminates barriers. This encourages word-of-mouth referrals and broad adoption, driving exponential growth


How We Operate with LPs
HomeInheriT bridges seniors and investors in a mutually beneficial ecosystem:
        Funding from LPs: Our LPs provide the debit line funding, ensuring efficient liquidity for seniors.
        Dynamic Real Estate Ownership: Equity is tokenized and transferred to LPs as funds are used, aligning cash flow with usage and minimizing idle capital.
        High-Yield, Low-Risk Investments for LPs: LPs benefit from real estate appreciation and mortality-based returns, creating an attractive investment vehicle.
        Scalable Model: The debit line structure allows HomeInheriT to scale operations efficiently while expanding its portfolio of senior homes.


Why Now?
With advancements in technology and the increasing financial needs of aging populations, HomeInheriT is uniquely positioned to disrupt the traditional home equity market.


Our innovative model addresses the shortcomings of existing solutions while providing seniors with unmatched flexibility, control, and security.

Tax Benefits: A Key Advantage
        Legacy Preservation: Unspent equity remains with the senior, appreciating alongside the home’s market value, and is passed on to heirs tax-free.


What Makes Us Different?
        Inheritance-Based Model: Our approach focuses on inheritance rather than fixed repayment timelines. This allows for shorter, more profitable investments as the average duration is typically less than the 10 years used by competitors.
        Higher Payouts for Seniors: By optimizing investment returns, we can offer seniors more money upfront compared to traditional models.
        Debt-Free Model: Seniors retain ownership without accruing interest or debt, ensuring financial security.
        Full Flexibility: Funds are accessed incrementally via a debit card, allowing seniors to use only what they need, with no upfront commitments or repayment schedules.
        Heir-Friendly Approach: Unspent equity and remaining ownership are passed to heirs tax-free, maximizing the value of the inheritance.
        Debt Allowed: Seniors can buy the home if they have debt on it, the debt remaining will be automatically paid off by their balance in the debit card.
How We Make Money
Revenue Streams
        1.Initial Fees:
        We retain 5% of the present value of the inheritance upon onboarding the senior. This is a direct revenue stream derived from the equity we tokenize when seniors join the program.
        2. Transaction Fees: 1.8% of the money they access


Advantages of the Revenue Model
* Retaining 5% of remainder interest ownership and converting it into cash as soon as the senior signs up provides immediate liquidity. 
* The flexibility to access as much of the 5% as needed ensures exceptional source of capital to drive rapid growth.






Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
        Industry Average: In financial services, the average CAC is approximately $1,200.
We will also have a closer commission of $2,000 and a referral commision of another $2,000.

Risk Assessment


1. Real Estate Market Fluctuations
While market fluctuations can impact the value of real estate, our model is designed to significantly reduce this risk. Every time a senior swipes their debit card, the value they access is based on the present value of their home inheritance. If the market drops significantly, the inheritance value adjusts automatically, meaning we pay less for the same percentage of ownership. This real-time adjustment ensures that our payouts align with current market conditions, protecting the company from severe downturns.




2. Adoption Barriers
Seniors are naturally cautious when it comes to new financial products. However, our program resonates strongly with their aversion to debt, offering a clear, interest-free alternative. We address their concerns through in-person consultations or direct discussions, ensuring they understand the benefits and ease of the program.
Family involvement can present challenges, as heirs often want to be included in the decision-making process. To address this, we involve families early and provide clear, concise explanations to help them understand how the model works. For seniors with cognitive challenges, we ensure their families are engaged and part of the decision-making process, fostering trust and transparency.


3. Operational Risks
Our operational model is built for simplicity and efficiency, which reduces the risk of errors and resistance during onboarding. From initial evaluations to ongoing support, our streamlined systems and communication strategies ensure a senior-friendly experience that inspires confidence and minimizes barriers to adoption.
