Real Estate Power Without the Market Noise
The Problem: Traditional Diversification No Longer Works
For decades, smart portfolio construction relied on a simple formula: balance stocks and bonds. When equities dropped, bonds would hold or rise. That balance helped smooth out returns and protect capital.
But that balance is breaking. Today, stocks and bonds often move in the same direction, especially during moments of economic stress. What used to be a natural hedge is now a synchronized risk.
The Search for Diversification Has Come Up Short
To solve this, many investors have turned to alternatives like REITs or crypto. But these options are not as non-correlated as they seem:
* Publicly-traded REITs show strong correlation to the stock market, sometimes as high as 0.76 with the S&P 500
* Crypto assets, while new and exciting, tend to behave like high-volatility tech stocks during market downturns
This creates a dangerous problem: a diversification gap. Your assets may look different on paper, but if they all react the same in a downturn, you're not diversified. You're concentrated.
True diversification means more than asset variety. It means holding assets that move differently from each other. That requires true decorrelation.

HomeInherit: Built for True Decorrelation
HomeInherit Capital was designed from day one to be different. Our returns are not just alternative. They are non-correlated by design. The key lies in two foundational elements of our model:
1. Actuarial-Driven Returns
Our core return engine is driven by actuarial data. It does not rely on interest rates, rent prices, inflation forecasts, or consumer sentiment. It is based on one of the most stable and predictable forces in modern finance: life expectancy.
We invest based on demographic patterns and major life events. These outcomes are statistical and biological, not economic. This creates return streams that are naturally detached from market cycles.
This return structure is similar in principle to life settlements, a long-standing institutional asset class known for its low volatility and independence from traditional markets.
2. Micro-Level Real Estate Exposure
We do invest in homes, but not in the way that REITs do. Our model avoids systemic housing exposure. Instead, we:
* Select individual homes in suburban neighborhoods, one by one
* Focus on localized trends, not national housing indices
* Add value at the property level through co-invested upgrades tailored to local buyers
The resale value of a home in Boca Raton is not dictated by the S&P 500 or the Fed's next meeting. It depends on micro-level conditions we can evaluate and influence.

Deconstructing Risk, Amplifying Returns
Our strategy systematically eliminates the most significant drivers of risk found in conventional real estate, while introducing powerful, decorrelated return drivers.
Actuarial-Driven Decorrelation
The primary source of our low volatility is that returns are fundamentally decorrelated from traditional markets. While conventional real estate returns are tied to economic cycles, and stocks and bonds are subject to broad market sentiment, our model's core performance is driven by actuarial science, a predictable, non-economic factor. The timing of our returns is linked to demographics, not market fluctuations, providing a powerful hedge in a diversified portfolio.
Elimination of Landlord Burdens
We incur no costs or risks associated with tenants, including vacancies, defaults, maintenance, or the legal complexities of eviction.
Asset Security
Every investment is secured by future ownership of a debt-free property, as any existing mortgage must be settled at onboarding.

A Multi-Faceted, Decorrelated Return Engine
Our projected 13.6 percent IRR is not based on speculation but is the calculated output of three distinct, quantifiable drivers:
9.1 Percent Actuarial Alpha
The core of our return is generated through a proprietary actuarial model that leverages U.S. government life-expectancy data. A Monte Carlo simulation of 50,000 investments demonstrates that a diversified portfolio consistently yields an average IRR of 9.1 percent, assuming 0 percent home price appreciation. It is a well-documented socioeconomic factor that financial hardship and lower income levels correlate with shorter life expectancies. These conditions are experienced by our target demographic of asset-rich, cash-poor seniors, which suggests our actuarial models may be conservative and returns could outperform projections.
3.0 Percent Home Appreciation
Our model's baseline portfolio volatility is exceptionally low. A diversified portfolio of 100 deals, driven purely by predictable actuarial outcomes, has a standard deviation of just 1.53 percent. The projected 6.5 percent increase in volatility is a direct and calculated result of layering on the dynamics of the South Florida real estate market, a region known for its cyclicality. However, we are not passively exposed to the general market. We are taking on this calculated risk to target a specific, powerful driver of appreciation.
Our strategy focuses on acquiring homes in desirable suburban neighborhoods from Boca Raton to Miami, areas that are seeing a surge in demand from inbound migration. These are often well-located properties owned by asset-rich, cash-poor seniors that may be undervalued relative to their potential. We are securing assets at the leading edge of a demographic and lifestyle-driven demand shift.
Our investment thesis is not dependent on this appreciation. Even if our market thesis proves incorrect and the region experiences a severe 4 percent yearly downturn, our performance modeling shows the fund is still projected to deliver a positive return above 8 percent. To further mitigate this localized risk, our long-term plan involves rapid diversification into other stable and appreciating U.S. markets as the fund scales.
1.5 Percent Targeted Home Improvements
We actively enhance asset value through a key operational focus on strategic home upgrades. The Fund offers to co-invest with homeowners in upgrades to boost a property's market value, which can significantly enhance the final sale price. Seniors always dreamed of upgrading their homes in certain areas. We offer them the capital and improve their experience if they do so. They keep 50 percent of the value generated. This creates significant upkeep at the cost of the homeowner. Our analysis shows that a full modernization could add up to 14 percent to the final home value, resulting in an approximate IRR uplift of 2.85 percent.

The Outcome: Where Real Estate Power Meets Portfolio Stability
When you combine the long-term reliability of residential real estate with the independence of actuarially-timed returns, you get something rare: a truly decorrelated, real-asset-backed strategy that enhances both sides of the portfolio equation.
This dual structure delivers:
* Real estate-backed capital preservation
* Predictable, event-driven cash flows
* Non-correlation to equities, fixed income, crypto, and public REITs
* Modeled downside deviation of just 8.03 percent
* Predicted near-zero beta to major financial markets
* Targeted 13.6 percent IRR
This is not a synthetic model or a hedge fund strategy. It is a simple, well-structured, passive real estate strategy,  engineered to behave differently when the rest of your portfolio doesn’t.
In our modeled analysis, allocating just 20 percent to HomeInherit Capital:
* Increased the Sharpe Ratio by 72 percent
* Reduced overall volatility
In today's connected markets, the best way to protect capital and grow wealth is through structural decorrelation. HomeInherit Capital delivers that — and does so through the stable foundation of U.S. housing.
