I. Human Impact
HITokens unlock the value of home inheritance equity to give seniors what they’ve earned: peace of mind, financial freedom, and the comfort of staying in their homes for life.
Your investment provides seniors with cash problems a fair access to their wealth while they live, without the fears of debt, eviction, or uncertainty.
II. Asset Backed Growth
Returns are engineered, not forecasted. HomeInherit Tokens represent future home ownership, and are not dependent on markets, leverage, or cycles.
III. Actuarial Timing as Yield
The passage of time itself generates return. Each position matures naturally as ownership evolves, creating a continuous, predictable yield independent of interest rates or sentiment. Creating our  low-correlation to equities or bonds.
IV. Entry Defines Outcome
Every acquisition begins below market value. By securing future ownership at a discount, alpha is locked in at deal creation, not hoped for at appreciation.
Each position matures predictably as ownership evolves, independent of markets or sentiment. 
V. Real Estate Alpha
The future home ownership keep selective exposure to major U.S. markets, starting with Florida & California.
We co-invest with seniors and upgrade the home before sale, capturing the appreciation others miss. Turning under-maintained assets into higher-value exits.
VI. Simplicity by Future Ownership
Future ownership eliminates tenant risks, rent caps. defaults, upkeep and reduces cost by not having to actively manage tenant issues, HomeInherit handles everything for a simple 2% management fee.
The future home ownership rights are held in an on-chain treasury (ERC-721 based) with the help of Propy. 
VII. On-Chain Digital Integrity.
Each token on-chain represents legal, direct ownership in the fund. Visible, verifiable, and secure. Each token confers direct, legal ownership in the fund. Creating a real asset, with digital integrity & RWA capabilities enabling on-chain borrowing.
VIII. Compounding Growth.
An evergreen structure lets HITokens compound indefinitely, re-deploying capital as positions mature, creating an on-chain RWA always growing. 
Periodic redemption windows combining with on & off-chain borrowing capabilities provide liquidity without disrupting growth.
