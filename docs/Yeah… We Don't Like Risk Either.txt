Yeah… We Don't Like Risk Either
Traditional real estate investing is filled with risk. Market crashes, problem tenants, unexpected repairs, and vacancies can turn a great investment into a major headache.
We designed our model to systematically remove these risks from the equation. Our goal is to provide the upside of real estate with a structure built for security, consistency, and long-term portfolio value.
No Landlords, No Problems
The biggest operational risks in real estate come from being a landlord. We eliminate them.
With our model, there are no tenants. This means:
* No vacancies
* No missed rent payments
* No maintenance calls or repairs
* No property management fees
* No eviction costs or legal hassles
The senior homeowner remains in their home and is responsible for all upkeep. We hold a passive interest without the costs or complexity of property management.
A Built-In Shock Absorber for Market Downturns
Our model is designed to be resilient, even in a declining market.
The amount we invest is based on the home's value at the time of the transaction. If market prices fall, our entry prices fall too. This structure acts as a natural hedge, preventing us from overpaying and allowing the fund to acquire assets more favorably during downturns.
In stress-tested financial models, our strategy continues to project positive performance even under a severe scenario where home prices fall by 4% annually for 10 years.
Secured, Debt-Free Assets with Diversification at the Core
Every investment is secured by a debt-free property. As a rule, any existing mortgage must be paid off as part of our deal structure, removing leverage risk at the asset level.
But we do more than just focus on asset quality. Our fund is built to be truly diversified. We combine many different remainder interests, each with its own timeline and return potential. By doing this, we reduce the impact of any single event. As the portfolio grows, the investment becomes more stable and predictable.
A single deal has a projected timing risk of about 15 percent. With 50 deals in the portfolio, that risk drops to around 2.2 percent. At 500 deals, it goes down even further to just 0.49 percent. This shows how adding more homes makes the fund more stable over time.
Deconstructing Risk, Amplifying Returns
Our model doesn’t just reduce risk. It introduces multiple return drivers that make our structure not only more resilient, but also potentially more rewarding.
Actuarial-Driven Decorrelation
Our primary return stream is based on actuarial timing, not rent income or economic cycles. This core performance is fundamentally decorrelated from traditional markets like equities, bonds, or even REITs. Returns are driven by demographics, not market sentiment.
Strategic Market Exposure
While our model does benefit from long-term real estate appreciation, our risk exposure is calculated. Even in the event of price declines, we expect to deliver strong net returns due to our acquisition discount and actuarial design.
Targeted Home Improvements
We work with homeowners to co-invest in strategic upgrades that increase home value. These upgrades (funded voluntarily and split in value) boost our exit prices without additional fund-level risk.
In Summary
HomeInherit Capital is engineered to remove the primary sources of real estate risk. Tenants, leverage, market timing and replace them with a structurally resilient, decorrelated return model.
We deliver exposure to single-family residential real estate without the stress of management, or the volatility of the market.
It's not just low-risk real estate. It's a smarter way to invest in it.
