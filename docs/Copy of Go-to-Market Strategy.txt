Go-to-Market Strategy: HomeInheritance Inc
1. Executive Summary
Millions of senior homeowners are 'house-rich but cash-poor,' unable to access their largest asset without taking on debt. HomeInherit solves this with a groundbreaking, debt-free financial solution that enables them to age in place with dignity and security. This strategy details our hyper-targeted initial market, a multi-phased customer acquisition plan built on trust, and the "wow-level" client experience that will define our brand and drive referrals.
2. The Ideal Customer:
Primary Targeting Criteria:
* Age: 77 years old.
   * Contingency: Expand to 78-year-olds if initial lead volume is insufficient.
* Financials:
   * Income: Under $40,000 per year.
   * Estimated Home Equity: Greater than $250,000.
* Household & Family Status:
   * Household Size: Strictly "1".
   * Marital Status: "Single" or "Widowed".
   * Heir Status: No children, with special priority for seniors with no heirs at all. This focus simplifies the decision-making process for the client and streamlines our closing cycle by reducing potential family-related complexities.
   * Exclusion Filter: Exclude properties where another individual with a 20+ year age difference resides.
* Geographic Focus (Initial Launch):
   * Specific, high-density senior zip codes in Miami-Dade and Broward counties (e.g., Hialeah, Coral Gables, Little Havana).
3. Customer Acquisition: A Trust-First, Multi-Channel Approach
Our customer acquisition model is designed to build trust from the very first touchpoint and is divided into three strategic pillars.
Pillar 1: The 72-Hour Trust Campaign (Direct Outreach)
This is our primary method for converting cold leads into warm, scheduled appointments.
1. Day 1: The Physical Anchor. We send a high-quality, oversized postcard or a note in a premium envelope (with a real stamp). The message is polite and sets a professional expectation.
Message Example: "[Name], My name is [Your Name] from HomeInherit. I'll be giving you a brief call on Wednesday to share an idea that's helping your neighbors stay in their homes for good, with no debt. If you'd prefer to connect sooner, my number is [Your #]."
2. Day 3: The Warm Call. Our trained, empathetic team makes the promised call. The opening is not a sales pitch but a polite follow-up.
Opening Script: "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] calling from HomeInherit. I sent you a quick note in the mail a couple of days ago, and I was just calling as promised to follow up. Did you happen to see it?"
Pillar 2: Senior Community Engagement (Boots-on-the-Ground)
This strategy builds trust and generates leads from within established senior communities.
   1. The "Hiring Event" Inroad: We approach community managers with a compelling offer: "We're a new South Florida company looking to hire locally... We'd like to host a 'Local Hiring' event for your residents."
   2. Hire "Community Partners": We hire 2-3 trusted residents per community. Their job is not to sell, but to make warm introductions for a $2,000 flat fee per successful client.
   3. The "Unlock Your Inheritance" Seminar: Following the hiring event, we host a free educational seminar for all residents, promoted by our new Community Partners. The presentation focuses on the "Three Nos": No Debt, No Payments, No Leaving Your Home. The call to action is to book a free, private home consultation.
Pillar 3: The Professional Referral Network
We will build a robust referral engine by creating win-win partnerships.
   * Real Estate Agents: Offer a $2,000 referral fee and, critically, future exclusive listing rights to the home, signed in advance.
   * Financial Advisors: Provide a $2,000 referral fee and a unique, debt-free tool that complements their retirement and estate planning services.
   * Charities & Senior-Focused Nonprofits: Offer a $2,000 referral fee structured as a donation to their organization, aligning our success with their mission.
4. The "Wow-Level" Client Onboarding & Experience
Our post-agreement process is designed to delight clients, reinforce their decision, and turn them into advocates.
   1. The Welcome Box: Upon signing, every client receives a premium, magnetic-clasp gift box containing:
   * A personalized, "handwritten" welcome letter on heavy, textured cardstock.
   * A beautifully designed brochure explaining the next steps in simple terms.
   * A thoughtful, locally sourced gift (e.g., artisanal honey, gourmet coffee).
   2. Dedicated Support: Each client is assigned a dedicated Property Manager who acts as their single point of contact for all questions, concerns, and coordination of home expenses. Our goal is to achieve a legendary level of service, making every senior feel empowered, safe, and seen.
5. Goals & Metrics (Year 1)
   * Primary Objective: Convert targeted prospects from the "Icarus" profile into qualified appointments.
   * Client Acquisition Goal: 200 clients.
   * Target Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $3,000 - $4,000.
   * Projected Revenue: ~$4.0M (based on 200 clients and an average fee of $20,000).
