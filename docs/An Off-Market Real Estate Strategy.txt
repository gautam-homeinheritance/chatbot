An Off-Market Real Estate Strategy
While institutional investors seek alternatives to reduce correlation and improve portfolio efficiency, most real estate strategies remain tied to public market cycles. And it i shard to find asset backed, decorrelated strategies. HomeInherit Capital offers a structurally different approach by providing access to a portfolio of off-market residential real estate assets.
Due to the intricate nature of our actuarial and legal processes, we are currently in negotiations to establish rights of first refusal with our foundational partners. This creates a scarce and time-sensitive opportunity for this initial allocation.
Capital Deployment Strategy
Our strategy is built on precision and diversification through a proprietary, actuarially-driven model.
* Portfolio Scale: We target approximately 60 investments for every €10 million in the fund. The average deployment per deal is projected to be around €150,000, allowing for broad diversification.
* Disciplined Allocation: Our capital is deployed with a singular focus:
   * 100% Future Home Ownership: All capital is used for the direct purchase of future home ownership.
* Efficient Process: Our sourcing and underwriting process is streamlined to move from lead identification to closing in approximately one to two weeks, enabling efficient capital deployment.
A Strategy Aligned with Homeowner Interests
Our model is fundamentally aligned with the interests of the seniors we partner with. We provide a financial solution that allows elderly homeowners to access equity without taking on debt or leaving their homes. This alignment creates tangible advantages:
* Deal Flow: Our proprietary customer-centric system generates access to off-market opportunities.
* Reduced Operational Drag: As seniors remain in their homes and are responsible for expenses, the fund is insulated from the typical risks and costs of property management.
* Asset Value Preservation: We can co-invest with homeowners on strategic improvements, which may enhance the future sale price of the asset while allowing the senior to enjoy a modernized home.
A Race Against Time
Our primary constraint is the pace of capital formation, which makes this initial fundraising period a key window for new partners. The investment model is designed to address common challenges in traditional real estate.
* Mitigated Deployment Risk: The capital call model ensures investor capital is drawn only once an asset has been identified and secured.
* Decorrelated Return Profile: Returns are primarily driven by predictable, actuarial data rather than market cycles.
* Projected Returns: The model projects returns of 13.6% with lower downside deviation than many traditional real estate investments.
In essence, HomeInherit Capital provides access to a non-correlated, asset-backed return stream insulated from market volatility. Our disciplined, actuarial approach and capital call model mitigate deployment risk while targeting consistent performance. The resulting alignment of interests between investors and homeowners is a durable competitive advantage. We welcome a discussion to explore this time-sensitive opportunity.
