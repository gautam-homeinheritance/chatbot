Why We’re Not a HEI, a Reverse Mortgage, a HELOC or Lending


Key differentiations:
* HEIs take a % of future appreciation
* ⁠They have a 10(or more) year settlement deadline
* It's equity sharing that behaves like debt with a due date


We buy a remainder interest — future ownership after death
* No shared upside, no forced sale, no clock
* Senior keeps a life estate, stays for life


Not Lending / Reverse Mortgage
* No interest
* No repayment
* No debt
* Not governed by lending laws
* We’re not a lender. We’re a buyer of future property rights.
* It's a real estate transaction, not a financial product.


Legal Structure
* ⁠IRS-compliant (IRC §121)
* Fully documented via deed
* No consumer lending exposure


Seniors: sell a future payout with strings.
Fund: buys a future asset with no strings.
